They are not part of the **$psISE** hierarchy.\n\n## Useful Scripting objects\n\n### $psUnsupportedConsoleApplications\n There are some limitations on how Windows PowerShell ISE interacts with console applications. A command or an automation script that requires user intervention might not work the way it works from the Windows PowerShell console. You might want to block these commands or scripts from running in the Windows PowerShell ISE Command pane. The **$psUnsupportedConsoleApplications** object keeps a list of such commands. If you try to run the commands in this list, you get a message that they are not supported. The following script adds an entry to the list.\n\n```\n# List the unsupported commands\npsUnsupportedConsoleApplications\n# Add a command to this list\npsUnsupportedConsoleApplications.Add(“Mycommand”)\n#Show the augmented list of commands\npsUnsupportedConsoleApplications\n\n```\n\n### $psLocalHelp\n This is a dictionary object that maintains a context\\-sensitive mapping between Help topics and their associated links in the local compiled HTML Help file. It is used to locate the local Help for a particular topic. You can add or delete topics from this list. The following code example shows some example key\\-value pairs that are contained in **$psLocalHelp**.\n\n```\n# See the local help map\n$psLocalHelp |Format-List\n\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n\n|||\n|-|-|\n|Key : Add\\-Computer|Value : WindowsPowerShellHelp.chm::\\/html\\/093f660c\\-b8d5\\-43cf\\-aa0c\\-54e5e54e76f9.htm|\n|Key : Add\\-Content|Value : WindowsPowerShellHelp.chm::\\/html\\/0c836a1b\\-f389\\-4e9a\\-9325\\-0f415686d194.htm|\n\n The following script adds an entry to the list.\n\n```\n$psLocalHelp.Add(\"get-myNoun\",\"c:\\MyFolder\\MyHelpChm.chm::/html/0198854a-1298-57ae-aa0c-87b5e5a84712.htm\")\n```\n\n### $psOnlineHelp\n This is a dictionary object that maintains a context\\-sensitive mapping between topic titles of Help topics and their associated external URLs.
