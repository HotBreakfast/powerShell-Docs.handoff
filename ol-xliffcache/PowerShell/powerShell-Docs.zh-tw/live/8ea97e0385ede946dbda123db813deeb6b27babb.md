# Windows PowerShell Tips
Tips in this section are supported by [!INCLUDE[psversion3](../Token/psversion3_md.md)] and later releases of Windows PowerShell. Topics in this section have been updated from archived [Windows PowerShell Tips](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh848797.aspx) that are supported by Windows PowerShell 1.0, and in some cases, 2.0.

Special thanks to Windows PowerShell MVP [Dave Wyatt](http://mvp.microsoft.com/mvp/Dave%20Wyatt-5000730) for his work to provide updated code samples for these tips.
