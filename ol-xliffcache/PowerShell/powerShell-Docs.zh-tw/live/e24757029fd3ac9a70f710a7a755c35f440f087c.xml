delegated administration for anything that can be managed with PowerShell.\nWith JEA, you can:\n- **Reduce the number of administrators on your machines** by leveraging virtual accounts that perform privileged actions on behalf of regular users.\n- **Limit what users can do** by specifying which cmdlets, functions, and external commands they can run.\n- **Better understand what your users are doing** with \"over the shoulder\" transcriptions that show you exactly what commands a user executed during a session.\n\n**Why is this important?**  \nConsider the common scenario where your DNS servers are co-located with your Active Directory Domain Controllers.\nYour DNS administrators need to have local administrator privileges to fix issues with the DNS server, but in order to do so you have to make them members of the highly privileged \"Domain Admins\" security group.\nThis approach effectively gives DNS Administrators control over your whole domain and access to all resources on

can provide the appropriate access to repair a poisoned DNS cache without unintentionally giving them rights to Active Directory, or to browse the file system, or run potentially dangerous scripts.\nBetter yet, when the JEA session is configured to use one-time privileged virtual accounts, your DNS adminstrators can connect to the server using *unprivileged* credentials and still be able to run privileged commands.\n\n## Availability\nJEA is being developed in parallel to Windows Server 2016, and is available on older versions of Windows through Windows Management Framework updates.\nThe current release of JEA is available on the following platforms:\n\n**Windows Server**\n- Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4 and higher\n- Windows Server 2012 R2, 2012, and 2008
