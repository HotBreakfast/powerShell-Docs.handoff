when used for the first time\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Resolution:** Perform one of the following actions:\n\n1.

Right click on “Windows PowerShell” and select “Run As Administrator” to launch in an elevated mode.\n\nOnce you have performed either of the above actions, the PowerShell shortcuts will work.

After installing WMF 5.0, open Powershell as an administrator.\n  2.    Run the cmdlet Set-SilLogging –TargetUri https://BlankTarget –CertificateThumbprint 0123456789\n  3.    Run the cmdlet Publish-SilData.  There will be an error, this is expected.\n  4.    Go to \\Windows\\System32\\Logfiles\\SIL\\ and delete any files in this directory.\n  5.    Ensure all available important Windows Updates are installed, and begin Sysyprep operation normally.\n\n\nWorkaround #2 – steps for systems running Windows Server 2012\n\n  1.    After installing WMF 5.0 on the server to be Sysprep’d, login as administrator.\n  2.    Copy Generize.xml from directory \\Windows\\System32\\Sysprep\\ActionFiles\\ to a location outside of the Windows directory, C:\\ for example.\n  3.    Open your Generalize.xml copy with notepad.\n  4.    Find and remove the following text, one instance of each needs to be deleted (they will be near the end of the document).\n      - `<sysprepOrder order=\"0x3200\"></sysprepOrder>`\n      - `<sysprepOrder order=\"0x3300\"></sysprepOrder>`\n  5.    Save the edited copy of Generalize.xml and close the file.\n  6.    Open a command prompt as administrator\n  7.    Run the following command to take ownership of the Generalize.xml file in system32 folder:\n      * Takeown /f C:\\Windows\\System32\\Sysprep\\ActionFiles\\Generalize.xml \n        * Assumes Windows is installed on the C: drive.\n  8.    Run the following command to set appropriate permission on the file:\n      * Cacls C:\\Windows\\System32\\ Sysprep\\ActionFiles\\Generalize.xml /G `<AdministratorUserName>`:F \n      * Answer Yes at the prompt for confirmation. \n        * Note that `<AdministratorUserName>` should be replaced by the username who is administrator on the machine. For example, \"Administrator\".\n  9.    Copy the file you edited and saved over to the Sysprep directory using the following command:\n      * Xcopy C:\\Generalize.xml C:\\Windows\\System32\\Sysprep\\ActionFiles\\Generalize.xml \n      * Answer Yes to overwrite (note that if there is no prompt to overwrite double check the path entered).\n        * Assumes your edited copy of Generalize.xml was copied to C:\\ .\n  10.   Generalize.xml is now updated with the workaround. Please run Sysprep with the generalize option enabled.\n\n"}
