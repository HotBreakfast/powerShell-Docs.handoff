In Windows PowerShell ISE, you can run commands and write, test, and debug scripts in a single Windows\\-based graphic user interface with multiline editing, tab completion, syntax coloring, selective execution, context\\-sensitive help, and support for right\\-to\\-left languages.\nYou can use menu items and keyboard shortcuts to perform many of the same tasks that you would perform in the Windows PowerShell console.  For example, when you debug a script in the Windows PowerShell ISE, to set a line breakpoint in a script, right\\-click the line of code, and then click **Toggle Breakpoint**.\n\nTry these features in Windows PowerShell ISE.\n\n-   Multiline editing: To insert a blank line under the current line in the Command pane, press SHIFT\\+ENTER.\n\n-   Selective execution: To run part of a script, select the text you want to run, and then click the **Run Script** button. Or, press F5.\n\n-   Context\\-sensitive help: Type **Invoke\\-Item**, and then press F1. The Help file opens to the Help topic for the **Invoke\\-Item** cmdlet.\n\nThe Windows PowerShell ISE lets you customize some aspects of its appearance. It also has its own Windows PowerShell profile, where you can store functions, aliases, variables, and commands you use in the Windows PowerShell ISE.\n\n### To start the Windows PowerShell ISE\n\n1.  Do one of the following:\n\n    -   Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Windows PowerShell V2**, and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**.\n\n    -   In the Windows PowerShell console Cmd.exe, or in the Run box, type, **powershell\\_ise.exe**.\n\n### To get Help in the Windows PowerShell ISE\n\n-   On the **Help** menu, click **Windows PowerShell Help**. Or, press F1. The file that opens describes Windows PowerShell ISE and Windows PowerShell, including all of the help available from the Get\\-Help cmdlet.\n\n"}
