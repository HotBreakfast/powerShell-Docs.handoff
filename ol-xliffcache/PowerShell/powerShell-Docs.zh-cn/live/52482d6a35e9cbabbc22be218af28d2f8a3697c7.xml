For example, when you debug a script in the [!INCLUDE[mshgraphicalhostshort](../Token/mshgraphicalhostshort_md.md)], to set a line breakpoint in a script, right\\-click the line of code, and then click **Toggle Breakpoint**.\n\nTry these features in [!INCLUDE[mshgraphicalhostshort](../Token/mshgraphicalhostshort_md.md)].\n\n-   Multiline editing: To insert a blank line under the current line in the Command pane, press SHIFT\\+ENTER.\n\n-   Selective execution: To run part of a script, select the text you want to run, and then click the **Run Script** button.
