DSC is flexible enough to function reliably and consistently in each stage of the deployment lifecycle (development, test, pre-production, production), as well as during scale-out. \n\nDSC centers around the idea of \"[configurations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/configurations)\", which are easy-to-read documents that describe an environment made up of computers (\"nodes\") with specific characteristics. These characteristics can be as simple as ensuring a specific Windows feature is enabled, or as complex as deploying SharePoint. \n\nDSC also has monitoring and reporting built in. If a system is no longer compliant, DSC can raise an alert and act to correct the system. \n\n## Benefits of Using Desired State Configuration ##\n\nConfigurations are designed to be easily read, stored, and updated.
