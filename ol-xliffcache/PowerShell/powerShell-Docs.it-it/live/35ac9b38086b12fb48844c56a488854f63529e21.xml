You can download the **PowerShellGet** module for PowerShell 3.0 and 4.0\n>at [PackageManagement PowerShell Modules Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49186). The **xSmbShare** contains the DSC resource **xSmbShare**, which can be used\nto create an SMB file share.\n\n### Create the directory and file share\n\nThe following configuration uses the [File](fileResource.md) resource to create the directory for the share, and the **xSmbShare** resource to set up the SMB share:\n\n```powershell\nConfiguration SmbShare {\n\nImport-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration\nImport-DscResource -ModuleName xSmbShare\n \n    Node localhost {\n \n        File CreateFolder {\n \n            DestinationPath = 'C:\\DscSmbShare'\n            Type = 'Directory'\n            Ensure = 'Present'\n \n        }\n \n        xSMBShare CreateShare {\n \n            Name = 'DscSmbShare'\n            Path = 'C:\\DscSmbShare'\n            FullAccess = 'admininstrator'\n            ReadAccess = 'myDomain\\Contoso-Server$'\n            FolderEnumerationMode = 'AccessBased'\n            Ensure = 'Present'\n            DependsOn = '[File]CreateFolder'\n \n        }\n        \n    }\n \n}\n```\n\nThe configuration creates the directory `C:\\DscSmbShare` if it doesn't already exists, and then uses that directory as an SMB file share. **FullAccess** should be given to any\naccount that needs to write to or delete from the file share, and **ReadAccess** must be given to any client nodes that will get configurations and/or DSC resources from the share (\nthis is because DSC runs as the system account by default, so the computer itself has to have access to the share).\n\n\n### Give file system access to the pull client\n\nGiving **ReadAccess** to a client node allows that node to access the SMB share, but not to files or folders within that share. You have to explicitly grant client nodes access to the SMB share\nfolder and sub-folders. We can do this with DSC by adding using the **cNtfsPermissionEntry** resource, which is contained in the [CNtfsAccessControl](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/cNtfsAccessControl/1.2.0)\nmodule. The following configuration adds a **cNtfsPermissionEntry** block that grants ReadAndExecute access to the pull client:\n\n```powershell\nConfiguration DSCSMB {\n\nImport-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration\nImport-DscResource -ModuleName xSmbShare\nImport-DscResource -ModuleName cNtfsAccessControl\n \n    Node localhost {\n \n        File CreateFolder {\n \n            DestinationPath = 'DscSmbShare'\n            Type = 'Directory'\n            Ensure = 'Present'\n \n        }\n \n        xSMBShare CreateShare {\n \n            Name = 'DscSmbShare'\n            Path = 'DscSmbShare'\n            FullAccess = 'administrator'\n            ReadAccess = 'myDomain\\Contoso-Server$'\n            FolderEnumerationMode = 'AccessBased'\n            Ensure = 'Present'\n            DependsOn = '[File]CreateFolder'\n \n        }\n\n        cNtfsPermissionEntry PermissionSet1 {\n            \n        Ensure = 'Present'\n        Path = 'C:\\DSCSMB'\n        Principal = 'myDomain\\Contoso-Server$'\n        AccessControlInformation = @(\n            cNtfsAccessControlInformation\n            {\n                AccessControlType = 'Allow'\n                FileSystemRights = 'ReadAndExecute'\n                Inheritance = 'ThisFolderSubfoldersAndFiles'\n                NoPropagateInherit = $false\n            }\n        )\n        DependsOn = '[File]CreateFolder'\n        \n        }\n \n        \n    }\n \n}\n```\n\n## Placing configurations and resources\n\nSave any configuration MOF files and/or DSC resources that you want client nodes to pull in the SMB share folder.\n\nAny configuration MOF file must be named _ConfigurationID_.mof, where _ConfigurationID_ is the value of the **ConfigurationID** property of the target node's LCM. For more information about\nsetting up pull clients, see [Setting up a pull client using configuration ID](pullClientConfigID.md).\n\n>**Note:** You must use configuration IDs if you are using an SMB pull server. Configuration names are not supported for SMB.\n\nAny resources needed by the client must be placed in the SMB share folder as archived `.zip` files.  \n\n## Creating the MOF checksum\nA configuration MOF file needs to be paired with a checksum file so that an LCM on a target node can validate the configuration. \nTo create a checksum, call the [New-DSCCheckSum](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521622.aspx) cmdlet. The cmdlet takes a **Path** parameter that specifies the folder \nwhere the configuration MOF is located. The cmdlet creates a checksum file named `ConfigurationMOFName.mof.checksum`, where `ConfigurationMOFName` is the name of the configuration mof file. \nIf there are more than one configuration MOF files in the specified folder, a checksum is created for each configuration in the folder.\n\nThe checksum file must be present in the same directory as the configuration MOF file (`$env:PROGRAMFILES\\WindowsPowerShell\\DscService\\Configuration` by default), and have the same name with the `.checksum` extension appended.\n\n>**Note**: If you change the configuration MOF file in any way, you must also recreate the checksum file.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to the following:\n\n- Mike F.
