It can be used by third-parties that want to take advantage of DSC resources. This cmdlet is typically used in combination with `refreshMode = ‘Disabled’` but can be used no matter what refreshMode is set to. Below are some examples of how to use the new cmdlet:\n\n## Ensure a file is present\n\n```powershell\n$result = Invoke-DscResource -Name File -Method Set -Property @{\n                            DestinationPath = \"$env:SystemDrive\\\\DirectAccess.txt\";\n                            Contents = 'This file is create by Invoke-DscResource'} -Verbose\n$result | fl\n```\n\n## Test that a file is present\n\n```powershell\n$result = Invoke-DscResource -Name File -Method Test -Property @{\n                            DestinationPath=\"$env:SystemDrive\\\\DirectAccess.txt\";\n                            Contents='This file is create by Invoke-DscResource'} -Verbose\n$result | fl\n```\n\n## Get the contents of file\n\n```powershell\n$result = Invoke-DscResource -Name File -Method Get -Property @{\n                            DestinationPath=\"$env:SystemDrive\\\\DirectAccess.txt\";\n                            Contents='This file is create by Invoke-DscResource'} -Verbose\n$result.ItemValue | fl\n```\n"
