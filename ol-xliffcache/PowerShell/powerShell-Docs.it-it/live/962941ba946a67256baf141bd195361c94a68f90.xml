The package can be installed when you create a VHD for a Nano Server by\nspecifying **Microsoft-NanoServer-DSC-Package** as the value of the **Packages** parameter of the **New-NanoServerImage** function. For example, if you are creating a VHD for a virtual\nmachine, the command would look like the following:\n\n```powershell\nNew-NanoServerImage -Edition Standard -DeploymentType Guest -MediaPath f:\\ -BasePath .\\Base -TargetPath .\\Nano1\\Nano.vhd -ComputerName Nano1 -Packages Microsoft-NanoServer-DSC-Package\n```\n\nFor information about installing and using Nano Server, as well as how to manage Nano Server with PowerShell Remoting, see \n[Getting Started with Nano Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt126167.aspx).\n\n\n## DSC features available on Nano Server\n\n Because Nano Server supports only a limited set of APIs compared to a full version of Windows Server, DSC on Nano Server does not have full functional parity with DSC running on \n full SKUs for the time being. DSC on Nano Server is in active development and is not yet feature complete.\n \n The following DSC features are currently available on Nano Server: \n\n\n* Both push and pull modes\n\n* All DSC cmdlets that exist on a full version of Windows Server, including the following: \n  * [Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn407378.aspx)\n  * [Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521621.aspx)   \n  * [Enable-DscDebug](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt517870.aspx)\n  * [Disable-DscDebug](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt517872.aspx)       \n  * [Start-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521623.aspx)\n  * [Stop-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt143542.aspx)\n  * [Get-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn407379.aspx)\n  * [Test-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn407382.aspx)      \n  * [Publish-DscConfiguraiton](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt517875.aspx) \n  * [Update-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt143541.aspx)\n  * [Restore-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn407383.aspx)\n  * [Remove-DscConfigurationDocument](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt143544.aspx)\n  * [Get-DscConfigurationStatus](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt517868.aspx)\n  * [Invoke-DscResource](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt517869.aspx)\n  * [Find-DscResource](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt517874.aspx)\n  * [Get-DscResource](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521625.aspx)\n  * [New-DscChecksum](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521622.aspx)    \n\n* Compiling configurations (see [DSC configurations](configurations.md))\n\n  **Issue:** Password encryption (see [Securing the MOF File](securemof.md)) during configuration compilation doesn't work.\n\n* Compiling metaconfigurations (see [Configuring the Local Configuration Manager](metaConfig.md))\n\n* Running a resource under user context (see [Running DSC with user credentials (RunAs)](runAsUser.md))\n\n* Class-based resources (see [Writing a custom DSC resource with PowerShell classes](authoringResourceClass.md))\n\n* Debugging of DSC resources (see [Debugging DSC resources](debugresource.md))\n  \n  **Issue:** Doesn't work if a resource is using PsDscRunAsCredential (see [Running DSC with user credentials](runAsUser.md))\n\n* [Specifying cross-node dependencies](crossNodeDependencies.md) \n\n* [Resource versioning](sxsResource.md)\n\n* Pull client (configurations & resources) (see [Setting up a pull client using configuration names](pullClientConfigNames.md))\n\n* [Partial configurations (pull & push)](partialConfigs.md)\n\n* [Reporting to pull server](reportServer.md) \n\n* MOF encryption\n\n* Event logging\n\n* Azure Automation DSC reporting\n\n* Resources that are fully functional\n  * [Archive](archiveResource.md)\n  * [Environment](environmentResource.md)\n  * [File](fileResource.md)\n  * [Log](logResource.md)\n  * ProcessSet\n  * [Registry](registryResource.md)\n  * [Script](scriptResource.md)\n  * WindowsPackageCab\n  * [WindowsProcess](windowsProcessResource.md)\n  * WaitForAll (see [Specifying cross-node dependencies](crossNodeDependencies.md))\n  * WaitForAny (see [Specifying cross-node dependencies](crossNodeDependencies.md))\n  * WaitForSome (see [Specifying cross-node dependencies](crossNodeDependencies.md))\n\n* Resources that are partially functional\n  * [Group](groupResource.md)\n  * GroupSet\n  \n  **Issue:** Above resources fail if specific instance is called twice (running the same configuration twice)\n  \n  * [Service](serviceResource.md)\n  * ServiceSet\n  \n  **Issue:** Only works for starting/stopping (status) service.
