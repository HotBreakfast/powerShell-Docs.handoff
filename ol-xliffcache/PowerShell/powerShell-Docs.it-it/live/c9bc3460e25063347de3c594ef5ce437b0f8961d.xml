them is similar to manipulating files and folders on Windows physical disk drives. We will discuss how to deal with specific file and folder manipulation tasks in this section.\n\n### Listing All the Files and Folders Within a Folder\nYou can get all items directly within a folder by using **Get\\-ChildItem**. Add the optional **Force** parameter to display hidden or system items. For example, this command displays the direct contents of Windows PowerShell Drive C (which is the same as the Windows physical drive C):\n\n```\nGet-ChildItem -Force C:\\\n```\n\nThe command lists only the directly contained items, much like using Cmd.exe's **DIR** command or **ls** in a UNIX shell. In order to show contained items, you need to specify the **\\-Recurse** parameter as well. (This can take an extremely long time to complete.) To list everything on the C drive:\n\n```\nGet-ChildItem -Force C:\\ -Recurse\n```\n\n**Get\\-ChildItem** can filter items with its **Path**, **Filter**, **Include**, and **Exclude** parameters, but those are typically based only on name. You can perform complex filtering based on other properties of items by using **Where\\-Object**.\n\nThe following command finds all executables within the Program Files folder that were last modified after October 1, 2005 and which are neither smaller than 1 megabyte nor larger than 10 megabytes:\n\n```\nGet-ChildItem -Path $env:ProgramFiles -Recurse -Include *.exe | Where-Object -FilterScript {($_.LastWriteTime -gt \"2005-10-01\") -and ($_.Length -ge 1m) -and ($_.Length -le 10m)}\n```\n\n### Copying Files and Folders\nCopying is done with **Copy\\-Item**. The following command backs up C:\\\\boot.ini to C:\\\\boot.bak:\n\n```\nCopy-Item -Path c:\\boot.ini -Destination c:\\boot.bak\n```\n\nIf the destination file already exists, the copy attempt fails. To overwrite a pre\\-existing destination, use the Force parameter:\n\n```\nCopy-Item -Path c:\\boot.ini -Destination c:\\boot.bak -Force\n```\n\nThis command works even when the destination is read\\-only.\n\nFolder copying works the same way. This command copies the folder C:\\\\temp\\\\test1 to the new folder c:\\\\temp\\\\DeleteMe recursively:\n\n```\nCopy-Item C:\\temp\\test1 -Recurse c:\\temp\\DeleteMe\n```\n\nYou can also copy a selection of items. The following command copies all .txt files contained anywhere in c:\\\\data to c:\\\\temp\\\\text:\n\n```\nCopy-Item -Filter *.txt -Path c:\\data -Recurse -Destination c:\\temp\\text\n```\n\nYou can still use other tools to perform file system copies. XCOPY, ROBOCOPY, and COM objects, such as the **Scripting.FileSystemObject,** all work in Windows PowerShell. For example, you can use the Windows Script Host **Scripting.FileSystem COM** class to back up C:\\\\boot.ini to C:\\\\boot.bak:\n\n```\n(New-Object -ComObject Scripting.FileSystemObject).CopyFile(\"c:\\boot.ini\", \"c:\\boot.bak\")\n```\n\n### Creating Files and Folders\nCreating new items works the same on all Windows PowerShell providers. If a Windows PowerShell provider has more than one type of item—for example, the FileSystem Windows PowerShell provider distinguishes between directories and files—you need to specify the item type.\n\nThis command creates a new folder C:\\\\temp\\\\New Folder:\n\n```\nNew-Item -Path 'C:\\temp\\New Folder' -ItemType \"directory\"\n```\n\nThis command creates a new empty file C:\\\\temp\\\\New Folder\\\\file.txt\n\n```\nNew-Item -Path 'C:\\temp\\New Folder\\file.txt' -ItemType \"file\"\n```\n\n### Removing All Files and Folders Within a Folder\nYou can remove contained items using **Remove\\-Item**, but you will be prompted to confirm the removal if the item contains anything else. For example, if you attempt to delete the folder C:\\\\temp\\\\DeleteMe that contains other items, Windows PowerShell prompts you for confirmation before deleting the folder:\n\n```\nRemove-Item C:\\temp\\DeleteMe\n\nConfirm\nThe item at C:\\temp\\DeleteMe has children and the -recurse parameter was not\nspecified. If you continue, all children will be removed with the item. Are you\nsure you want to continue?\n[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help\n(default is \"Y\"):\n```\n\nIf you do not want to be prompted for each contained item, specify the **Recurse** parameter:\n\n```\nRemove-Item C:\\temp\\DeleteMe -Recurse\n```\n\n### Mapping a Local Folder as a Windows Accessible Drive\nYou can also map a local folder, using the **subst** command. The following command creates a local drive P: rooted in the local Program Files directory:\n\n```\nsubst p: $env:programfiles\n```\n\nJust as with network drives, drives mapped within Windows PowerShell using **subst** are immediately visible to the Windows PowerShell shell.\n\n### Reading a Text File into an Array\nOne of the more common storage formats for text data is in a file with separate lines treated as distinct data elements. The **Get\\-Content** cmdlet can be used to read an entire file in one step, as shown here:\n\n```\nPS> Get-Content -Path C:\\boot.ini\n[boot loader]\ntimeout=5\ndefault=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\WINDOWS\n[operating systems]\nmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\WINDOWS=\"Microsoft Windows XP Professional\"\n /noexecute=AlwaysOff /fastdetect\nmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\WINDOWS=\" Microsoft Windows XP Professional \nwith Data Execution Prevention\" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect\n```\n\n**Get\\-Content** already treats the data read from the file as an array, with one element per line of file content. You can confirm this by checking the **Length** of the returned content:\n\n```\nPS> (Get-Content -Path C:\\boot.ini).Length\n6\n```\n\nThis command is most useful for getting lists of information into Windows PowerShell directly. For example, you might store a list of computer names or IP addresses in a file C:\\\\temp\\\\domainMembers.txt, with one name on each line of the file. You can use **Get\\-Content** to retrieve the file contents and put them in the variable **$Computers**:\n\n```\n$Computers = Get-Content -Path C:\\temp\\DomainMembers.txt\n```\n\n**$Computers** is now an array containing a computer name in each element.\n\n"}
