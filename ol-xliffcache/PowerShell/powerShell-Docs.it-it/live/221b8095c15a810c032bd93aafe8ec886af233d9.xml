For example:\n\n```\nif ($host.UI.SupportsVirtualTerminal)\n{\n    $esc = [char]0x1b\n    \"A yellow ${esc}[93mhello${esc}[0m\"\n}\nelse\n{\n    \"A default hello\"\n}\n```\nHere is a complete [example](https://gist.github.com/lzybkr/dcb973dccd54900b67783c48083c28f7) that can be used to highlight matches from Select-String.\nSave the example in a file named `MatchInfo.format.ps1xml`, then to use it, in your profile or elsewhere, run `Update-FormatData -Prepend MatchInfo.format.ps1xml`.\n\nNote that VT100 escape sequences are only supported starting with the Windows 10 Anniversary update; they are not supported on earlier systems.   \n\n### Vi mode support in PSReadline\n\n[PSReadline](https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine) adds support for vi mode. To use vi mode, run `Set-PSReadline -EditMode vi`.\n\n### Redirected stdin w/ interactive input \n\nIn earlier versions, starting PowerShell with `powershell -File -` was required when stdin was redirected and\nyou wanted to enter commands interactively.\n\nWith WMF 5.1, this hard to discover option is no longer necessary, you can start powershell without any options, e.g. `powershell`.\n\nNote that PSReadline does not currently supported redirected stdin, and the builtin commanding line editing experience with redirected\nstdin is extremely limited, e.g. arrow keys don't work.  A future release of PSReadline should address this issue.   \n"}
