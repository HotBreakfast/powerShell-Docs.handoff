Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 include Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 by default.\n\nWindows PowerShell 3.0 requires the full installation of Microsoft .NET Framework 4. Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 include Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 by default, which fulfills this requirement.\n\nTo install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 (dotNetFx45\\_Full\\_setup.exe), see [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=242919) on the Microsoft Download Center.\n\nTo install the full installation of Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (dotNetFx40\\_Full\\_setup.exe), see [Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Web Installer)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=212931) on the Microsoft Download Center.\n\n## WS\\-Management 3.0\nWindows PowerShell 3.0 and Windows PowerShell 4.0 require WS\\-Management 3.0, which supports the WinRM service and WSMan protocol. This program is included in Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows Management Framework 4.0, and Windows Management Framework 3.0.\n\n## Windows Management Instrumentation 3.0\nWindows PowerShell 3.0 and Windows PowerShell 4.0 require Windows Management Instrumentation 3.0 (WMI). This program is included in Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows Management Framework 4.0, and Windows Management Framework 3.0. If this program is not installed on the computer, features that require WMI, such as CIM commands, do not run.\n\n## Common Language Runtime 4.0\nWindows PowerShell 3.0 and Windows PowerShell 4.0 are compiled against Common Language Runtime (CLR) 4.0.\n\n## Graphical User Interface Requirements\nWindows PowerShell is a console\\-based application that does not require a graphical user interface. As such, is it well suited to computers that do not have screens or monitors, or a user interface, such as the Server Core installation options of Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012.\n\nHowever, some items, such as the following, require a graphical user interface. For details, see the help topic for each item.\n\n-   Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE)\n\n-   Cmdlets\n\n    1.

Cmdlets, providers, snap\\-ins, modules, and scripts written for Windows PowerShell 2.0 and Windows PowerShell 3.0 run unchanged in Windows PowerShell 4.0.\n\nHowever, due to a change in the runtime activation policy in Microsoft .NET Framework 4, Windows PowerShell host programs that were written for Windows PowerShell 2.0 and compiled with Common Language Runtime (CLR) 2.0 cannot run without modification in Windows PowerShell 3.0, which is compiled with CLR 4.0.\n\nThe Windows PowerShell 2.0 engine requires Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.50727 at a minimum. This requirement is fulfilled by Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1. This requirement is not fulfilled by Microsoft .NET Framework 4 and later releases of Microsoft .NET Framework.\n\nFor information about adding or installing the Windows PowerShell 2.0 engine, and adding or installing the required versions of the Microsoft .NET Framework, see [Installing the Windows PowerShell 2.0 Engine](Installing-the-Windows-PowerShell-2.0-Engine.md).
