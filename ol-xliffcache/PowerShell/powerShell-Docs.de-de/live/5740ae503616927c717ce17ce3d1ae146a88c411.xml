  "content": "# Debugging DSC resources\n\n> Applies To: Windows PowerShell 5.0\n\nIn PowerShell 5.0, a new feature was introduced in Desired State Configuraiton (DSC) that allows you to debug a DSC resource as a configuration is being applied.\n\n## Enabling DSC debugging\nBefore you can debug a resource, you have to enable debugging by calling the [Enable-DscDebug](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt517870.aspx) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes a mandatory parameter, **BreakAll**. You can verify that debugging has been enabled by looking at the result of a call to [Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn407378.aspx). The following PowerShell output shows the result of enabling debugging:\n\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\DebugTest> $LCM = Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager\n\nPS C:\\DebugTest> $LCM.DebugMode\nNONE\n\nPS C:\\DebugTest> Enable-DscDebug -BreakAll\n\nPS C:\\DebugTest> $LCM = Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager\n\nPS C:\\DebugTest> $LCM.DebugMode\nForceModuleImport\nResourceScriptBreakAll\n\nPS C:\\DebugTest>\n```\n\n\n## Starting a configuration with debug enabled\nTo debug a DSC resource, you start a configuration that calls that resource. For this example, we'll look at a simple configuration that calls the [WindowsFeature](windowsfeatureResource.md) resource to ensure that the \"WindowsPowerShellWebAccess\" feature is installed:\n\n```powershell\nConfiguration PSWebAccess\n    {\n    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'PsDesiredStateConfiguration'\n    Node localhost\n        {\n        WindowsFeature PSWA\n            {\n            Name = 'WindowsPowerShellWebAccess'\n            Ensure = 'Present'\n            }\n        }\n    }\nPSWebAccess\n```\nAfter compiling the configuration, start it by calling [Start-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521623.aspx). The configuration will stop when the\nLocal Configuration Manager (LCM) calls into the first resoure in the configuration. If you use the `-Verbose` and `-Wait` parameters, the output displays the lines you need to enter\nto start debugging.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\DebugTest> Start-DscConfiguration .\\PSWebAccess -Wait -Verbose\nVERBOSE: Perform operation 'Invoke CimMethod' with following parameters, ''methodName' = SendConfigurationApply,'className' = MSFT_DSCLocalConfiguration\nManager,'namespaceName' = root/Microsoft/Windows/DesiredStateConfiguration'.\nVERBOSE: An LCM method call arrived from computer TEST-SRV with user sid S-1-5-21-2127521184-1604012920-1887927527-108583.\nVERBOSE: An LCM method call arrived from computer TEST-SRV with user sid S-1-5-21-2127521184-1604012920-1887927527-108583.\nVERBOSE: [TEST-SRV]: LCM:  [ Start  Set      ]\nWARNING: [TEST-SRV]:                            [DSCEngine] Warning LCM is in Debug 'ResourceScriptBreakAll' mode.
