[Appendix](#appendix): Important skills and discussion points\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Motivation\nWhen you grant someone privileged access to your systems, you extend your trust boundary to that person.\nThis is a risk -- administrators are an attack surface.\nInsider attacks and stolen credentials are both real and common.\n\nThis is not a new problem.\nYou are probably very familiar with the principle of least privilege, and you might use some form of role based access control (RBAC) with applications that provide it.\nHowever, the effectiveness and manageability of these solutions are often limited by their broad scope and imprecision.\nFurthermore, there are gaps in RBAC coverage.\nFor example, in Windows, privileged access is largely a binary switch, forcing you to give unnecessary permissions when adding users to the Administrators group.\n\nJust Enough Administration (JEA) provides a RBAC platform through PowerShell Remoting.\n*It allows specific users to perform specific administrative tasks on servers without giving them administrator rights.*\nThis allows you to fill in the gaps between your existing RBAC solutions, and simplifies management of those settings.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Initial State\nBefore starting this section, please ensure the following:\n\n1. JEA is available on your system. Check out the [README](./README.md) for the current supported operating systems and required downloads.\n2. You have administrative rights on the computer where you are trying out JEA.\n3. The computer is domain joined.\nSee the [Creating a Domain Controller](#creating-a-domain-controller) section to quickly set up a new domain on a server if you don't already have one.\n\n### Enable PowerShell Remoting\nManagement with JEA occurs through PowerShell Remoting.\nRun the following in an Administrator PowerShell window to ensure that this is enabled and configured properly:\n\n```PowerShell\nEnable-PSRemoting \n```\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with PowerShell remoting, it would be a good idea to run `Get-Help about_Remote` to learn about this important foundational concept.\n\n### Identify Your Users or Groups\nTo show JEA in action, you need to identify the non-administrator users and groups you are going to use throughout this guide.\n  \nIf you're using an existing domain, please identify or create some unprivileged users and groups.\nYou will give these non-administrators access to JEA.\nAnytime you see the `$NonAdministrator` variable in a top of a script, assign it to your selected non-administrator users or groups. \n\nIf you created a new domain from scratch, it's much easier.\nPlease use the [Set Up Users and Groups](#set-up-users-and-groups) section in the appendix to create a non-administrator users and groups.\nThe default values of `$NonAdministrator` will be the groups created in that section.\n\n### Set Up Maintenance Role Capability File\nRun the following commands in PowerShell to create the demo Role Capability file we will be using for the next section.\nLater in this guide, you will learn about what this file does.\n\n```PowerShell\n# Fields in the role capability\n$MaintenanceRoleCapabilityCreationParams = @{\n    Author = 'Contoso Admin'\n    CompanyName = 'Contoso'\n    VisibleCmdlets = 'Restart-Service'\n    FunctionDefinitions = \n            @{ Name = 'Get-UserInfo'; ScriptBlock = { $PSSenderInfo } }\n}\n\n# Create the demo module, which will contain the maintenance Role Capability File\nNew-Item -Path \"$env:ProgramFiles\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Demo_Module\" -ItemType Directory\nNew-ModuleManifest -Path \"$env:ProgramFiles\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Demo_Module\\Demo_Module.psd1\"\nNew-Item -Path \"$env:ProgramFiles\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Demo_Module\\RoleCapabilities\" -ItemType Directory \n\n# Create the Role Capability file\nNew-PSRoleCapabilityFile -Path \"$env:ProgramFiles\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Demo_Module\\RoleCapabilities\\Maintenance.psrc\" @MaintenanceRoleCapabilityCreationParams \n```\n  \n### Create and Register Demo Session Configuration File\nRun the following commands to create and register the demo Session Configuration file we will be using for the next section.\nLater in this guide, you will learn about what this file does.\n\n```PowerShell\n# Determine domain\n$domain = (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain\n\n# Replace with your non-admin group name\n$NonAdministrator = \"$domain\\JEA_NonAdmin_Operator\"\n\n# Specify the settings for this JEA endpoint\n# Note: You will not be able to use a virtual account if you are using WMF 5.0 on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2\n$JEAConfigParams = @{\n    SessionType = 'RestrictedRemoteServer'\n    RunAsVirtualAccount = $true\n    RoleDefinitions = @{\n        $NonAdministrator = @{ RoleCapabilities = 'Maintenance' }\n    }\n    TranscriptDirectory = \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\Transcripts\"\n}\n\n# Set up a folder for the Session Configuration files\nif (-not (Test-Path \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\"))\n{\n    New-Item -Path \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\" -ItemType Directory\n}\n\n# Specify the name of the JEA endpoint\n$sessionName = 'JEA_Demo'\n\nif (Get-PSSessionConfiguration -Name $sessionName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)\n{\n    Unregister-PSSessionConfiguration -Name $sessionName -ErrorAction Stop\n}\n\nNew-PSSessionConfigurationFile -Path \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\JEADemo.pssc\" @JEAConfigParams\n\n# Register the session configuration\nRegister-PSSessionConfiguration -Name $sessionName -Path \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\JEADemo.pssc\"\n```\n \n### Enable PowerShell Module Logging (Optional)\nThe following steps enable logging for all PowerShell actions on your system.\nYou don't need to enable this for JEA to work, but it will be useful in the [Reporting on JEA](#reporting-on-jea) section.\n\n1. Open the Local Group Policy Editor\n2. Navigate to \"Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows PowerShell\"\n3. Double Click on \"Turn on Module Logging\"\n4. Click \"Enabled\"\n5. In the Options section, click on \"Show\" next to Module Names\n6. Type \"*\" in the pop up window. This means PowerShell will log commands from all modules.\n7. Click OK and apply the policy\n\nNote: you can also enable system-wide PowerShell transcription through Group Policy.\n\n**Congratulations, you have now configured your computer with the demo endpoint and are ready to get started with JEA!**\n\n## Using JEA\nThis section focuses on understanding the end user experience of *using JEA*.\nIn the prerequisites section, you created a demo JEA endpoint.\nWe will use this demo to show JEA in action.\nIn later sections, the guide will work backwards -- introducing the actions and files that made that end-user experience possible.\n\n### Using JEA as a Non-Administrator\nTo show JEA in action, you will need to use PowerShell remoting as though you were a non-administrator user.\nRun the following command in a new PowerShell window:   \n\n```PowerShell\n$NonAdminCred = Get-Credential\n```\n\nEnter the credentials for your non-administrator account when prompted.\nIf you followed the [Set Up Users and Groups](#set-up-users-and-groups) section, they will be:\n-   Username = \"OperatorUser\"\n-   Password = \"pa$$w0rd\"\n\nNext, run the following command to connect to the demo endpoint using the credentials you provided:\n\n```PowerShell\nEnter-PSSession -ComputerName . -ConfigurationName JEA_Demo -Credential $NonAdminCred \n```\n\nYou have now entered an interactive remote PowerShell session on the local machine. \nBy using the \"Credential\" parameter, you have connected *as though you were* OperatorUser (or whichever account you used).\nThe change in the prompt to `[localhost]: PS>` indicates that you are operating against a remote session.  \n\nRun the following in your remote command prompt to show the commands available to you:\n\n```PowerShell\nGet-Command \n```\n\nAs you can tell, this is a very limited subset of the commands available in a normal PowerShell window (which can often include several thousand commands).\nSpecifically, it only shows the 7 default JEA cmdlets (Clear-Host, Exit-PSSession, Get-Command, Get-FormatData, Get-Help, Measure-Object, Out-Default, Select-Object) and the two commands explicitly included in the maintenance Role Capability file.\n\nNext, let's take a look at the user context this session is operating under by invoking the custom function included in the maintenance Role Capability file:\n\n```PowerShell\nGet-UserInfo\n```\n \nThe output of this function shows the \"ConnectedUser\" as well as the \"RunAsUser.\"\nThe connected user is the account that connected to the remote session (e.g. your account).\nThe connected user does not need to have administrator privileges.\nThe \"Run As\" account is the account actually performing the privileged actions.\nBy connecting as one user, and running as a privileged user, we allow non-privileged users to preform specific administrative tasks without giving them administrative rights.\n\nTo demonstrate this in action, run the following command:\n\n```PowerShell\nRestart-Service -Name Spooler -Verbose\n```\n\nNormally, Restart-Service requires administrator privileges to be run.\nWith the JEA virtual account, however, we're able to run it using non-privileged credentials.\n\nSo, JEA lets you get your job done using the commands you already use.\nBut what about commands you *shouldn't* be allowed to use?\nTry running a different command in the JEA session, like `Restart-Computer`, and notice that JEA prevents such commands from being executed.\n\n```PowerShell\n[localhost]: PS> Restart-Computer\nThe term 'Restart-Computer' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or\noperable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path\nis correct and try again.\n    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (Restart-Computer:String) [], CommandNotFoundException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException \n```\n\nFinally, to leave the constrained JEA endpoint, run the following command:\n\n```PowerShell\nExit-PSSession\n```\n\nThis disconnects you from the remote PowerShell session.\n\n## Remake the Demo Endpoint\nIn this section, you will learn how to generate an exact replica of the demo endpoint you used in the above section.\nThis will introduce core concepts that are necessary to understand JEA, including PowerShell Session Configurations and Role Capabilities. \n\n### PowerShell Session Configurations\nWhen you used JEA in the above section, you started by running the following command:\n\n```PowerShell\nEnter-PSSession -ComputerName . -ConfigurationName JEA_Demo -Credential $NonAdminCred\n```\n\nWhile most of the parameters are self-explanatory, the *ConfigurationName* parameter may seem confusing at first.\nThat parameter specified the PowerShell Session Configuration to which you were connecting. \n\n*PowerShell Session Configuration* is a fancy term for a PowerShell endpoint.\nIt is the figurative \"place\" where users connect and get access to PowerShell functionality.\nBased on how you set up a Session Configuration, it can provide different functionality to connecting users.\nFor JEA, we use Session Configurations to restrict PowerShell to a limited set of functionality and to run as a privileged virtual account.\n\nYou already have several registered PowerShell Session Configurations on your machine, each set up slightly differently.\nMost of them come with Windows, but the \"JEA_Demo\" Session Configuration was set up in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.\nYou can see all registered Session Configurations by running the following command in an Administrator PowerShell prompt:\n\n```PowerShell\nGet-PSSessionConfiguration\n```\n\n### PowerShell Session Configuration Files\nYou can make new Session Configurations by registering new *PowerShell Session Configuration Files*.\nSession Configuration Files have \".pssc\" file extensions.\nYou can generate Session Configuration Files with the New-PSSessionConfigurationFile cmdlet.\n\nNext, you are going to create and register a new Session Configuration for JEA. \n\n### Generate and Modify your PowerShell Session Configuration\nRun the following command to generate a PowerShell Session Configuration \"skeleton\" file.\n\n```PowerShell\nNew-PSSessionConfigurationFile -Path \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\JEADemo2.pssc\"\n```\n\n> **TIP:** Only the most common configuration settings are included in the skeleton file by default.\n> Use the `-Full` parameter to include all applicable settings in the generated PSSC.\n\nOpen the file in PowerShell ISE, or your favorite text editor.\n\n```PowerShell\nise \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\JEADemo2.pssc\" \n```\n\nUpdate the following fields in the file with the values below (remember to substitue in your own non-administrator security group): \n\n```PowerShell\n# OLD: SessionType = 'Default'\nSessionType = 'RestrictedRemoteServer'\n\n# OLD: TranscriptDirectory = 'C:\\Transcripts\\'\nTranscriptDirectory = \"C:\\ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\Transcripts\"\n\n# OLD: # RunAsVirtualAccount = $true\nRunAsVirtualAccount = $true\n\n# OLD: RoleDefinitions = @{ 'CONTOSO\\SqlAdmins' = @{ RoleCapabilities = 'SqlAdministration' }; 'CONTOSO\\ServerMonitors' = @{ VisibleCmdlets = 'Get-Process' } }\nRoleDefinitions = @{'CONTOSO\\JEA_NonAdmin_Operator' = @{ RoleCapabilities =  'Maintenance' }}\n```\n\nHere is what each of those entries mean:\n\n1.  The *SessionType* field defines preset default settings to use with this endpoint.\n*RestrictedRemoteServer* defines the minimal settings necessary for remote management. \nBy default, a *RestrictedRemoteServer* endpoint will expose Get-Command, Get-FormatData, Select-Object, Get-Help, Measure-Object, Exit-PSSession, Clear-Host, and Out-Default.\nIt will set the *ExecutionPolicy* to *RemoteSigned*, and the *LanguageMode* to *NoLanguage*.\nThe net effect of these settings is a secure and minimal starting point for configuring your endpoint.\n\n2.  The *RoleDefinitions* field assigns Role Capabilities to specific groups.\nIt defines who can do what as a privileged account.\nWith this field, you can specify the functionality available to any connecting user based on group membership.\nThis is the core of JEA's RBAC functionality.\nIn this example, you are exposing the pre-made \"Demo\" RoleCapability to members of the \"Contoso\\JEA_NonAdmin_Operator\" group.\n\n3.  The *RunAsVirtualAccount* field indicates that PowerShell should \"run as\" a Virtual Account at this endpoint.\nBy default, the Virtual Account is a member of the built in Administrators group.\nOn a domain controller, it is also a member of the Domain Administrators group by default.\nLater in this guide, you will learn how to customize the privileges of the Virtual Account.\n\n4.  The *TranscriptDirectory* field defines where \"over-the-shoulder\" PowerShell transcripts are saved after each remote session.\nThese transcripts allow you to inspect the actions taken in each session in a readable way.\nFor more information about PowerShell transcripts, check out this [blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2015/06/09/powershell-the-blue-team.aspx).\nNote: regular Windows Eventing also captures information about what each user ran with PowerShell.\nTranscripts are just a bit more readable.\n\nFinally, save your changes to *JEADemo2.pssc*.\n\n### Apply the PowerShell Session Configuration \n\nTo create an endpoint from a Session Configuration file, you need to register the file.\nThis requires a few pieces of information:\n\n1. The path to the Session Configuration file.\n2. The name of your registered Session Configuration. This is the same name users provide to the \"ConfigurationName\" parameter when they connect to your endpoint with `Enter-PSSession` or `New-PSSession`.\n\nTo register the Session Configuration on your local machine, run the following command:\n\n```PowerShell\nRegister-PSSessionConfiguration -Name 'JEADemo2' -Path \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\JEADemo2.pssc\"\n```\n\nCongratulations! You have set up your JEA endpoint.\n\n### Test Out Your Endpoint\nRe-run the steps listed in the [Using JEA](#using-jea) section against your new endpoint to confirm it is operating as intended.\nBe sure to use the new endpoint name (JEADemo2) when providing the configuration name to Enter-PSSession.\n\n```PowerShell\nEnter-PSSession -ComputerName . -ConfigurationName JEADemo2 -Credential $NonAdminCred\n```\n\n### Key Concepts\n**PowerShell Session Configuration**:\nSometimes referred to as *PowerShell Endpoint*, this is the figurative \"place\" where users connect and get access to PowerShell functionality.\nYou can list the registered Session Configurations on your system by running `Get-PSSessionConfiguration`.\nWhen configured in a specific way, a PowerShell Session Configuration can be called a *JEA Endpoint*.\n\n**PowerShell Session Configuration File (.pssc)**:\nA file that, when registered, defines settings for a PowerShell Session Configuration.\nIt contains specifications for user roles that can connect to the endpoint, the \"run as\" Virtual Account, and more.     \n\n**Role Definitions**:\nThe field in a Session Configuration File that defines the Role Capabilities granted to connecting users.\nIt defines *who* can do *what* as a privileged account.\nThis is the core of JEA's RBAC capabilities.\n\n**SessionType**:\nA field in a Session Configuration File that represents default settings for a Session Configuration.\nFor JEA endpoints, this must be set to RestrictedRemoteServer.\n\n**PowerShell Transcript**:\nA file containing an \"over-the-shoulder\" view of a PowerShell session.\nYou can set PowerShell to generate transcripts for JEA sessions using the TranscriptDirectory field.\nFor more information on transcripts, check out this [blog post](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff687007.aspx).\n\n## Role Capabilities\n\n### Overview\nIn the above section, you learned that the \"RoleDefinitions\" field defined which groups had access to which Role Capabilities.\nYou may have wondered, \"What are Role Capabilities?\"\nThis section will answer that question.  \n\n## Introducing PowerShell Role Capabilities\nPowerShell Role Capabilities define \"what\" a user can do at a JEA endpoint.\nThey detail a whitelist of things like visible commands, visible applications, and more.\nRole Capabilities are defined by files with a \".psrc\" extension.\n\n## Role Capability Contents\nWe will start by examining and modifying the demo Role Capability file you used before.\nImagine you have deployed your Session Configuration across your environment, but you have gotten feedback that you need to change the capabilities exposed to users.\nOperators need the ability to restart machines, and they also want to be able to get information about network settings.\nIn addition, the security team has told you that allowing users to run \"Restart-Service\" without any restrictions is not acceptable.\nYou need to restrict the services that operators can restart.\n\nTo make these changes, start by running PowerShell ISE as an Administrator and open the following file:\n\n```\nC:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Demo_Module\\RoleCapabilities\\Maintenance.psrc\n```\n\nNow find and update the following lines in the file: \n\n```PowerShell\n# OLD: VisibleCmdlets = 'Restart-Service'\nVisibleCmdlets = 'Restart-Computer',\n                 @{\n                     Name = 'Restart-Service'\n                     Parameters = @{ Name = 'Name'; ValidateSet = 'Spooler' }\n                 },\n                 'NetTCPIP\\Get-*'\n\n# OLD: VisibleExternalCommands = 'Item1', 'Item2'\nVisibleExternalCommands = 'C:\\Windows\\system32\\ipconfig.exe'\n```\n\nThis contains a few interesting examples:\n\n1.  You have restricted Restart-Service such that operators will only be able to use Restart-Service with the -Name parameter, and they will only be allowed to provide \"Spooler\" as an argument to that parameter.\nIf you wanted to, you could also restrict the arguments using a regular expression using \"ValidatePattern\" instead of \"ValidateSet\".\n\n2.  You have exposed all commands with the \"Get\" verb from the NetTCPIP module.\nBecause \"Get\" commands typically don't change system state, this is a relatively safe action.\nThat being said, it is strongly encouraged to closely examinine every command you expose through JEA.\n\n3.  You have expose an executable (ipconfig) using VisibleExternalCommands.\nYou can also expose full PowerShell scripts with this field.\nIt is important to always provide the full path to external commands to ensure a similarly named (and potentially malicous) program placed in the user's path does not get executed instead.\n\nSave the file, then connect to the demo endpoint again to confirm the changes worked.\n\n```PowerShell\nEnter-PSSession -ComputerName . -ConfigurationName JEADemo2 -Credential $NonAdminCred\nGet-Command\n```\nBecause you only modified the Role Capability file, you do not need to re-register the Session Configuration.\nPowerShell will automatically find your updated Role Capability when a user connects.\nSince Role Capabilities are loaded when the session starts, existing sessions are not affected by updates to Role Capability files.\n\nNow, confirm that you can restart the computer by running Restart-Computer with the -WhatIf parameter (unless you actually want to restart the computer).\n\n```PowerShell\nRestart-Computer -WhatIf \n```\n\nConfirm that you can run \"ipconfig\"\n\n```PowerShell\nipconfig\n```\n\nAnd finally, confirm that Restart-Service only works for the Spooler service.\n\n```PowerShell\nRestart-Service Spooler # This should work\nRestart-Service WSearch # This should fail \n```\n\nExit the session when you are finished.\n\n```PowerShell\nExit-PSSession \n```\n\n### Role Capability Creation\nIn the next section, you will create a JEA endpoint for AD help desk users.\nTo prepare, we will create a blank Role Capability file to fill in for that section.\nRole Capabilities must be created inside a \"RoleCapabilities\" folder inside a valid PowerShell module in order to be resolved when a session starts.\n\nPowerShell Modules are essentially packages of PowerShell functionality.\nThey can contain PowerShell functions, cmdlets, DSC Resources, Role Capabilities, and more.\nYou can find information about modules by running `Get-Help about_Modules` in a PowerShell console.\n\nTo create a new PowerShell module with a blank Role Capability file, run the following commands:  \n\n```PowerShell\n# Create a new folder for the module.\nNew-Item -Path 'C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Contoso_AD_Module' -ItemType Directory\n\n# Add a module manifest to contain metadata for this module.\nNew-ModuleManifest -Path 'C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Contoso_AD_Module\\Contoso_AD_Module.psd1' -RootModule Contoso_AD_Module.psm1\n\n# Create a blank script module.

Identify the tasks you need to enable\n2.  Restrict those tasks as necessary\n3.  Confirm they work with JEA\n4.  Put them in a Role Capability file\n5.  Register a Session Configuration that exposes that Role Capability\n\n### Step 1: Identify What Needs to Be Exposed\nBefore you make a new Role Capability or Session Configuration, you need to identify all of the things users will need to do through the JEA endpoint, as well as how to do them through PowerShell.\nThis will involve a fair amount of requirement gathering and research.\nHow you go about this process will depend on your organization and goals.\nIt is important to call out requirement gathering and research as a critical part of the real world process.\nThis may be the most difficult step in the process of adopting JEA.\n\n#### Find Resources\nHere is a set of online resources that might have come up in your research on creating an Active Directory management endpoint:\n-   [Active Directory PowerShell Overview](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adpowershell/archive/2009/03/05/active-directory-powershell-overview.aspx) \n-   [CMD to PowerShell Guide for Active Directory](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ashleymcglone/archive/2013/01/02/free-download-cmd-to-powershell-guide-for-ad.aspx)\n\n#### Make a List\nHere is a set of ten actions that you will be working from in the remainder of this section.\nKeep in mind this is simply an example, your organizations requirements may be different:\n\n|Action                                                         |PowerShell Command                                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Account Unlock                                                 |`Unlock-ADAccount`                                             |\n|Password Reset                                                 |`Set-ADAccountPassword` and `Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon`|\n|Change a User's Title                                          |`Set-ADUser -Title`                                            |  \n|Find AD Accounts that are locked out, disabled, inactive, etc. |`Search-ADAccount`                                             | \n|Add User to Group                                              |`Add-ADGroupMember -Identity (with whitelist) -Members`        | \n|Remove User from Group                                         |`Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity (with whitelist) -Members`     | \n|Enable a user account                                          |`Enable-ADAccount`                                             |\n|Disable a user account                                         |`Disable-ADAccount`                                            |\n\n### Step 2: Restrict Tasks as Necessary\n\nNow that you have your list of actions, you need to think through the capabilities of each command.\nThere are two important reasons to do this:\n\n1.  It is easy to expose give users more capabilities than you intend.\nFor example, `Set-ADUser` is an incredibly powerful and flexible command.\nYou may not want to expose everything it can do to help desk users.  \n\n2.  Even worse, it's possible to expose commands that allow users to escape JEA's restrictions.\nIf this happens, JEA ceases to function as a security boundary.\nPlease be careful when selecting commands.\nFor example, Invoke-Expression will allow users to run unrestricted code.\nFor more discussion on this topic, check out the Considerations When Restricting Commands section.\n\nAfter reviewing each command, you decide to restrict the following:\n\n1.  `Set-ADUser` should only be allowed to run with the \"-Title\" parameter \n\n2.  `Add-ADGroupMember` and `Remove-ADGroupMember` should only work with certain groups\n\n### Step 3: Confirm the Tasks Work with JEA\nActually using those cmdlets may not be straightforward in the restricted JEA environment.\nJEA runs in *No Language* mode which, among other things, prevents users from using variables.\nIn order to ensure that end users have a smooth experience, it's important to check for a few things.\n\nAs an example, consider `Set-ADAccountPassword`.\nThe \"-NewPassword\" parameter requires a secure string.\nOften, users create a secure string and pass it in as a variable (as below):\n\n```PowerShell\n$newPassword = (Read-Host -Prompt \"Specify a new password\" -AsSecureString)\nSet-ADAccountPassword -Identity mollyd -NewPassword $newPassword -Reset\n```\n\nHowever, No Language mode prevents the usage of variables.\nYou can get around this restriction in two ways:\n\n1.  You can require users run the command without assigning variables.\nThis is easy to configure, but can be painful for the operators using the endpoint.\nWho wants to type this out every time you reset a password?\n```PowerShell\nSet-ADAccountPassword -Identity mollyd -NewPassword (Read-Host -Prompt \"Specify a new password\" -AsSecureString) -Reset\n```\n\n2.  You can wrap the complexity in a script or a function that you expose to end users.\nScripts and functions that you expose run in an unrestricted context; you can write functions that use variables and call other commands without any issue.\nThis approach simplifies the end user experience, prevents errors, reduces required PowerShell knowledge, and reduces unintentionally exposing excess functionality.\nThe only downside is the cost of authoring and maintaining the function.\n\n#### Aside: Adding a Function to your Module\nTaking approach #2, you are going to write a PowerShell function called `Reset-ContosoUserPassword`.\nThis function is going to do everything that needs to happen when you reset a user's password.\nIn your organization, this may involve doing fancy and complicated things.\nBecause this is just an example, your command will just reset the password and require the user change the password at logon.\nWe will put it in the Contoso_AD_Module module you made in the last section.\n\n1. In PowerShell ISE, open \"Contoso_AD_Module.psm1\"\n```PowerShell\nISE 'C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Contoso_AD_Module\\Contoso_AD_Module.psm1' \n```\n\n2. Press Crtl+J to open the snippets menu.\n\n3. Key down until you find \"function\" and press enter.\nThis puts up a super basic skeleton of a function.\n\n4. Rename the function \"Reset-ContosoUserPassword\".  \n\n5. Rename one of the parameters \"Identity\" and delete the second.\n\n6. Copy the following into the body of the function.\n```PowerShell\n# Get the new password\n$NewPassword = Read-Host -Prompt \"Enter a new password\" -AsSecureString\n# Reset the password\nSet-ADAccountPassword -Identity $Identity -NewPassword $NewPassword -Reset\n# Require the user to reset at next logon\nSet-ADUser -Identity $Identity -ChangePasswordAtLogon\n```\n\n7. Save the file.\nYou should end up with something that looks like this:\n```PowerShell\nfunction Reset-ContosoUserPassword ($Identity)\n{\n# Get the new password\n$NewPassword = Read-Host -Prompt \"Enter a new password\" -AsSecureString\n# Reset the password\nSet-ADAccountPassword -Identity $Identity -NewPassword $NewPassword -Reset\n# Require the user to reset at next logon\nSet-ADUser -Identity $Identity -ChangePasswordAtLogon\n} \n```\nNow, your users can simply call `Reset-ContosoUserPassword` and not have to remember the syntax to create a secure string inline.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Role Capability File\nIn the [Role Capability Creation](#role-capability-creation) section, you created a blank Role Capability file.\nIn this section, you will fill in the values in that file.\n\nStart by opening the role capability file in ISE.\n```PowerShell\nise 'C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Contoso_AD_Module\\RoleCapabilities\\ADHelpDesk.psrc' \n```\nUpdate the file with the following changes:\n```PowerShell\n# OLD: VisibleCmdlets = 'Invoke-Cmdlet1', @{ Name = 'Invoke-Cmdlet2'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'Parameter1'; ValidateSet = 'Item1', 'Item2' }, @{ Name = 'Parameter2'; ValidatePattern = 'L*' } }\nVisibleCmdlets =\n    'Unlock-ADAccount',\n    'Search-ADAccount',\n    'Enable-ADAccount',\n    'Disable-ADAccount',\n    @{ Name = 'Set-ADUser'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'Title'; ValidateSet = 'Manager', 'Engineer' }},\n    @{ Name = 'Add-ADGroupMember'; Parameters = \n        @{Name = 'Identity'; ValidateSet = 'TestGroup'},\n        @{Name = 'Members'}},\n    @{ Name = 'Remove-ADGroupMember'; Parameters = \n        @{Name = 'Identity'; ValidateSet = 'TestGroup'},\n        @{Name = 'Members'}}\n  \n# OLD: VisibleFunctions = 'Invoke-Function1', @{ Name = 'Invoke-Function2'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'Parameter1'; ValidateSet = 'Item1', 'Item2' }, @{ Name = 'Parameter2'; ValidatePattern = 'L*' } }   \nVisibleFunctions = 'Reset-ContosoUserPassword'\n```\n\nThere are a few things to note about the above:\n1.  PowerShell will attempt to auto-load the modules needed for your Role Capability.\nYou may need to explicitly list module names in the \"ModulesToImport\" field if you notice problems with a module not being autoloaded.\n\n2.  If you aren't sure if a command is a cmdlet or a function, run `Get-Command` and look at the \"CommandType\"\n\n3.  The ValidatePattern allows you to use a regular expression to restrict parameter arguments if it is not easy to define a set of allowable values.\nYou cannot define both a ValidatePattern and ValidateSet for a single parameter.\n\n### Step 5: Register a new Session Configuration\nNext, you will create a new session configuration file that will expose your Role Capability to members of the \"JEA_NonAdmin_HelpDesk\" AD group. \n\nStart by creating and opening a new blank Session Configuration file in PowerShell ISE.\n```PowerShell\nNew-PSSessionConfigurationFile -Path \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\HelpDeskDemo.pssc\" \nise \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\HelpDeskDemo.pssc\"\n```\nModify the following fields in the PSSC file.\nIf you are working in your own environment, you should replace \"CONTOSO\\JEA_NonAdmins_Helpdesk\" with your own non-administrator user or group.\n```PowerShell\n# OLD: Description = ''\nDescription = 'An endpoint for active directory tasks.' \n\n# OLD: SessionType = 'Default'\nSessionType = 'RestrictedRemoteServer'\n\n# OLD: TranscriptDirectory = 'C:\\Transcripts\\'\nTranscriptDirectory = \"C:\\ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\Transcripts\"\n\n# OLD: RunAsVirtualAccount = $true\nRunAsVirtualAccount = $true\n\n# OLD: RoleDefinitions = @{ 'CONTOSO\\SqlAdmins' = @{ RoleCapabilities = 'SqlAdministration' }; 'CONTOSO\\ServerMonitors' = @{ VisibleCmdlets = 'Get-Process' } }\nRoleDefinitions = @{ 'CONTOSO\\JEA_NonAdmin_HelpDesk' = @{ RoleCapabilities =  'ADHelpDesk' }} \n```\nSave and register the Session Configuration\n```PowerShell\nRegister-PSSessionConfiguration -Name ADHelpDesk -Path \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\HelpDeskDemo.pssc\" \n```\n### Test It Out!\nGet your non-administrator user credentials:\n```PowerShell\n$HelpDeskCred = Get-Credential\n```\nIf you followed the Set Up Users and Groups section, the credentials will be:\n-   Username = \"HelpDeskUser\"\n-   Password = \"pa$$w0rd\"\n\nRemote into the AD Helpdesk endpoint using the non-admin credential:\n```PowerShell\nEnter-PSSession -ComputerName . -ConfigurationName ADHelpDesk -Credential $HelpDeskCred \n```\nUse Set-ADUser to reset a user's title.\n```PowerShell\nSet-ADUser -Identity OperatorUser -Title Engineer \n```\nVerify that the title has changed.\n```PowerShell\nGet-ADUser -Identity OperatorUser -Property Title \n```\nNow, use Add-ADGroupMember to add a user to the TestGroup.\nNote: make sure you've created the TestGroup beforehand.\n```PowerShell\nAdd-ADGroupMember TestGroup -Member OperatorUser -Verbose \n```\nExit the session:\n```PowerShell\nExit-PSSession\n```\n### Key Concepts\n**NoLanguage Mode**:\nWhen PowerShell is in \"NoLanguage\" mode, users may only run commands; they cannot use any language elements.\nFor more information, run `Get-Help about_Language_Modes`.\n\n**PowerShell Functions**:\nPowerShell functions are bits of PowerShell code that you can call by name.\nFor more information, run `Get-Help about_Functions`.\n\n**ValidateSet/ValidatePattern**:\nWhen exposing a command, you can restrict valid arguments for specific parameters.\nA ValidateSet is a specific list of valid commands.\nA ValidatePattern is a regular expression that the arguments for that parameter must match.\n\n## Multi-machine Deployment and Maintenance\nAt this point, you have deployed JEA to local systems several times.\nBecause your production environment probably consists of more than one machine, it's important to walk through the critical steps in the deployment process that must be repeated on each machine.\n\n### High Level Steps:\n1.  Copy your modules (with Role Capabilities) to each node.\n2.  Copy your session configuration files to each node.\n3.  Run `Register-PSSessionConfiguration` with your session configuration.\n4.  Keep a copy of your session configuration and toolkits in a secure location.\nAs you make modifications, it's good to have a \"single source of truth.\"\n\n### Example Script\nHere's an example script for deployment.\nTo use it in your environment, you'll have to use the names/paths of real file shares and modules.\n```PowerShell\n# First, copy the session configuration and modules (containing role capability files) onto a file share you have access to.\nCopy-Item -Path 'C:\\Demo\\Demo.pssc' -Destination '\\\\FileShare\\JEA\\Demo.pssc'\nCopy-Item -Path 'C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\SomeModule\\' -Recurse -Destination '\\\\FileShare\\JEA\\SomeModule'\n\n# Next, author a setup script (C:\\JEA\\Deploy.ps1) to run on each individual node\n    # Contents of C:\\JEA\\Deploy.ps1\n    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path C:\\JEADeploy\n    Copy-Item -Path '\\\\FileShare\\JEA\\Demo.pssc' -Destination 'C:\\JEADeploy\\'\n    Copy-Item -Path '\\\\FileShare\\JEA\\SomeModule' -Recurse -Destination 'C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules' # Remember, Role Capability Files are found in modules\n    if (Get-PSSessionConfiguration -Name JEADemo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)\n    {\n        Unregister-PSSessionConfiguration -Name JEADemo -ErrorAction Stop\n    }\n\n    Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name JEADemo -Path 'C:\\JEADeploy\\Demo.pssc'\n    Remove-Item -Path 'C:\\JEADeploy' # Don't forget to clean up!\n\n# Now, invoke the script on all of the target machines.\n# Note: this requires PowerShell Remoting be enabled on each machine. Enabling PowerShell remoting is a requirement to use JEA as well.\n# You may need to provide the \"-Credential\" parameter if your current user account does not have admin permissions on these machines.\nInvoke-Command –ComputerName 'Node1', 'Node2', 'Node3', 'NodeN' -FilePath 'C:\\JEA\\Deploy.ps1'\n\n# Finally, delete the session configuration and role capability files from the file share.\nRemove-Item -Path '\\\\FileShare\\JEA\\Demo.pssc'\nRemove-Item -Path '\\\\FileShare\\JEA\\SomeModule' -Recurse\n```\n### Modifying Capabilities\nWhen dealing with many machines, it's important that modifications are rolled out in a consistent manner.\nOnce JEA has a DSC Resource, this will help ensure your environment is in sync.\nUntil that time, we highly recommend you keep a master copy of your session configurations and re-deploy each time you make a modification.\n\n### Removing Capabilities\nTo remove your JEA configuration from your systems, use the following command on each machine:\n```PowerShell\nUnregister-PSSessionConfiguration -Name JEADemo \n```\n## Reporting on JEA\nBecause JEA allows non-privileged users to run in a privileged context, logging and auditing are extremely important.\nIn this section, we'll run through the tools you can use to help you with logging and reporting.\n\n### Reporting on JEA Actions\n#### Over-the-Shoulder Transcription\nOne of the quickest ways to get a summary of what's happening in a PowerShell session is to look over the shoulder of the person typing.\nYou see their commands, the output of those commands, and all is well.\nOr it's not, but at least you'll know.\nPowerShell transcription is designed to give you a similar view after the fact.\n\nWhen using the \"TranscriptDirectory\" field in your Session Configuration, PowerShell will automatically record a transcript of all actions taken in a given session.\nYou can find transcripts from your sessions in this document here: \"$env:ProgramData\\JEAConfiguration\\Transcripts\"\n\nAs you can tell, the transcript records information about the \"Connected\" user, the \"Run As\" user, the commands run in the session, and more.\nFor more information about PowerShell transcription, check out [this blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2015/06/09/powershell-the-blue-team.aspx).\n\n#### PowerShell Event Logs\nWhen you have module logging turned on, all PowerShell actions are also recorded in regular Windows Event logs.\nThis is slightly messier to deal with when compared to transcripts, but the level of detail it gives you can be useful.\n\nIn the \"PowerShell\" operational log, Event ID 4104 will record each command invoked if you have enabled module logging.\n\n#### Other Event Logs\nUnlike PowerShell logs and transcripts, other logging mechanisms will not capture the \"Connected User\".\nYou will need to do some correlation between other logs and PowerShell logs to match up actions taken.\n\nIn the \"Windows Remote Management\" operational log, Event ID 193 will record the Connecting User's SID and Name, as well as the RunAs Virtual Account's SID to assist with this correlation.\nYou may have also noticed that the name of the RunAs Virtual Account includes the connecting user's domain and username at the end.\n\n### Reporting on JEA Configuration\n#### Get-PSSessionConfiguration\nIn order to accurately report on the state of your environment, it's important to know how many JEA endpoints you have set up on your machine.\n`Get-PSSessionConfiguration` does just that.\n \n#### Get-PSSessionCapability\nManually reporting on the capabilities of any given user through a JEA endpoint can be quite complex.\nYou would potentially need to inspect several role capabilities.\nFortunately, the \"Get-PSSessionCapability\" cmdlet does this.\n\nTo test this out, run the following command from an administrator PowerShell prompt:\n```PowerShell\nGet-PSSessionCapability -Username 'CONTOSO\\OperatorUser' -ConfigurationName JEADemo\n```\n## Conclusion \nAfter completing this guide, you should have the tools and vocabulary to create your own JEA endpoint. Thanks for reading!\n\n## Appendix\n\n## Key Concepts Used Throughout This Guide\n**PowerShell Remoting**:\nPowerShell remoting allows you to run PowerShell commands against remote machines.\nYou can operate against one or many computers, and use either temporary or persistent connections.\nIn this demo, you remoted into your local machine with an interactive session.\nJEA restricts the functionality available through PowerShell remoting.\nFor more information about PowerShell remoting, run `Get-Help about_Remote`.\n\n**\"RunAs\" User**:\nWhen using JEA, a non-administrator \"runs as\" a privileged \"Virtual Account.\"\nThe Virtual Account only lasts the duration of the remote session.\nThat is to say, it is created when a user connects to the endpoint, and destroyed when the user ends the session.\nBy default, the Virtual Account is a member of the local Administrators group.\nOn a domain controller, it is a member of Domain Admins.\nVirtual Accounts are local to the machine on which they are created, and do not have permissions outside of that machine.\nThis means that they are not registered in Active Directory (no RID is assigned).\nAdditionally, if an allowed command/script tries to access resources outside of the local machine, it will be accessing those resources under the machine's identity, not the Virtual Account identity.\n\n**\"Connected\" User**:\nThe non-administrator user who connects to the JEA endpoint and to whom roles are assigned.\nAny commands this user runs are run under the context of the RunAs User or virtual account.\n\n\n### Creating a Domain Controller\n\nThis document assumes that your machine is domain joined.\nIf you currently don't have a domain to join, this section can help you quickly stand up a domain controller using DSC.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n1.  The machine is on an internal network\n2.  The machine is not joined to an existing domain\n3.  The machine is running Windows Server 2016 or has WMF 5.0 installed\n\n#### Install xActiveDirectory\nIf your machine has an active internet connection, run the following command in an elevated PowerShell window:\n```PowerShell\nInstall-Module xActiveDirectory -Force \n```\nIf you do not have an internet connection, install xActiveDirectory to another machine and then copy the xActiveDirectory folder to the \"C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\" folder on your machine.\n\nTo confirm the installation succeeded, run the following command:\n```PowerShell\nGet-Module xActiveDirectory -ListAvailable\n``` \n\n#### Set up a domain with DSC\nCopy the following script in PowerShell to make your machine a Domain Controller in a new domain.\n**AUTHOR'S NOTE: THERE IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE CREDENTIALS PROVIDED NOT BEING USED.  TO BE SAFE, DON'T FORGET YOUR LOCAL ADMIN PASSWORD.**\n\n```PowerShell\nSet-Item WSMan:\\localhost\\Client\\TrustedHosts -Value $env:COMPUTERNAME -Force \n\n# This \"MetaConfiguration\" sets the DSC Engine to automatically reboot if required\n[DscLocalConfigurationManager()]\nConfiguration MetaConfiguration\n{\n    Node $env:Computername\n    {\n        Settings\n        {\n            RebootNodeIfNeeded = $true\n        }\n    }\n    \n}\n\nMetaConfiguration\n# Apply the MetaConfiguration\nSet-DscLocalConfigurationManager .\\MetaConfiguration\n\n# Configure a domain controller of a new \"Contoso\" domain\nconfiguration DomainController\n{\n    param\n    (\n        $node,\n        $cred\n    )\n    Import-DscResource -ModuleName xActiveDirectory\n\n    Node $node\n    {\n        WindowsFeature ADDS\n        {\n            Ensure = 'Present'\n            Name = 'AD-Domain-Services'\n        }\n\n        xADDomain Contoso\n        {\n            DomainName = 'contoso.com'\n            DomainAdministratorCredential = $cred\n            SafemodeAdministratorPassword = $cred\n            DependsOn = '[WindowsFeature]ADDS'\n        }\n\n        file temp\n        {\n            DestinationPath = 'C:\\temp.txt'\n            Contents = 'Domain has been created'\n            DependsOn = '[xADDomain]Contoso'\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n$ConfigData = @{\n    AllNodes = @(\n        @{\n            NodeName = $env:Computername\n            PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true\n        }\n    )\n}\n\n# Enter your desired password for the domain administrator (note, this will be stored as plain text)\nDomainController -cred (Get-Credential -Message \"Enter desired credential for domain administrator\") -node $env:Computername -configurationData $ConfigData\n\n# Apply the configuration to create the domain controller\nStart-DSCConfiguration -path .\\DomainController -ComputerName $env:Computername -Wait -Force -Verbose\n```\nYour machine will restart a few times.\nYou will know the process is complete once you see a file called \"C:\\temp.txt\" containing \"Domain has been created.\" \n\n#### Set up Users and Groups\nThe following commands will set up an Operator and Helpdesk group in your domain and a corresponding non-administrator user who is a member of that group.\n```PowerShell\n# Make Groups\n$NonAdminOperatorGroup = New-ADGroup -Name \"JEA_NonAdmin_Operator\" -GroupScope DomainLocal -PassThru\n$NonAdminHelpDeskGroup = New-ADGroup -Name \"JEA_NonAdmin_HelpDesk\" -GroupScope DomainLocal -PassThru\n$TestGroup = New-ADGroup -Name \"Test_Group\" -GroupScope DomainLocal -PassThru\n\n# Make Users\n$OperatorUser = New-ADUser -Name \"OperatorUser\" -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString \"pa`$`$w0rd\" -AsPlainText -Force) -PassThru\nEnable-ADAccount -Identity $OperatorUser\n\n$HelpDeskUser = New-ADUser -name \"HelpDeskUser\" -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString \"pa`$`$w0rd\" -AsPlainText -Force) -PassThru\nEnable-ADAccount -Identity $HelpDeskUser\n\n# Add Users to Groups\nAdd-ADGroupMember -Identity $NonAdminOperatorGroup -Members $OperatorUser\nAdd-ADGroupMember -Identity $NonAdminHelpDeskGroup -Members $HelpDeskUser\n```\n\n### On Blacklisting\nAfter playing around with JEA, you may be wondering if it is possible to blacklist commands.\nThis is an understandable request, but it is not currently planned for JEA for the following reasons:\n\n1.  We designed JEA to limit operators to only the actions they need to do.\nA blacklist is the opposite.\n\n2.  PowerShell command authors did not design PowerShell commands with the JEA in mind.\nOn a fresh install of Windows Server 2016, there are about 1520 commands immediately available.\nThe threat models for these commands did not include the possibility that a user would be running commands as a more privileged account.\nFor example, certain commands allow for code injection by design (e.g. Add-Type and Invoke-Command in the core PowerShell module).\nJEA can warn you when you expose the specific commands we know about, but we have not re-assessed every other command in Windows based on the new threat model.\nYou must understand the capabilities of the commands you exposing through JEA.  \n\n3.  Furthermore, even if JEA blocked all commands with code-injection vulnerabilities, there is no guarantee that a malicious user would not be able to carry out a blacklisted action with another related command.\nUnless you understand all of the commands that you are exposing, it is impossible for you to guarantee that a certain action is not possible.\nThe burden is on you to understand what commands you are exposing, whether they are using a whitelist or a blacklist.\nThe number of commands a blacklist would expose is unmanageable, so JEA is implemented using whitelists instead.\n\n### Considerations When Limiting Commands\nThere is one important point to make about this step.\nIt is critical that all capabilities exposed through JEA are located in administrator-restricted areas.\nNon-administrator users should not have the capability to modify the scripts used through JEA endpoints.\n\nOn a related note, it is critical that you do not give JEA users the ability to overwrite JEA configurations and whitelisted scripts within their JEA sessions.\nBe extremely careful when exposing commands like `Copy-Item`!\n\n### Common Role Capability Pitfalls\nYou may run into a few common pitfalls into you go through this process yourself.\nHere is a quick guide explaining how to identify and remediate these issues when modifying or creating a new endpoint:\n\n#### Functions vs. Cmdlets\nPowerShell commands written in PowerShell are PowerShell Functions.\nPowerShell commands written as specialized .NET classes are PowerShell Cmdlets.\nYou can check the command type by running `Get-Command`.\n\n#### VisibleProviders \nYou will need to expose any providers your commands need.\nThe most common is the FileSystem provider, but you may also need to expose others, like the Registry provider.\nFor an introduction to providers, check out this [Hey, Scripting Guy blog post](http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2015/04/20/find-and-use-windows-powershell-providers.aspx).\nBe careful when exposing providers -- often, it is better to define your own function that works with the underlying providers than to directly expose the provider in a JEA session.\nThis way, you can still allow users to work with files, registry keys, etc. but retain control over **which* files and registry keys they can work with using custom validation logic."}
