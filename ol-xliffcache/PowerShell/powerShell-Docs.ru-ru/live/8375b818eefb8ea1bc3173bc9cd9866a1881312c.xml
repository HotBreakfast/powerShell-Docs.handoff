Once your script is paused by a breakpoint, you can run commands in the Console Pane to examine the state of your script.  You can output variables or run other commands. You can even modify the value of any variables that are visible to the context of the currently running script. After you have examined what you want to see, you can resume operation of the script.\n\nYou can set three types of breakpoints in the Windows PowerShell debugging environment:\n\n1.  **Line breakpoint**. The script pauses when the designated line is reached during the operation of the script\n\n2.  **Variable breakpoint.** The script pauses whenever the designated variableâ€™s value changes.\n\n3.  **Command breakpoint.** The script pauses whenever the designated command is about to be run during the operation of the script. It can include parameters to further filter the breakpoint to only the operation you want. The command can also be a function you created.\n\nOf these, in the [!INCLUDE[ise_2](../Token/ise_2_md.md)] debugging environment, only line breakpoints can be set by using the menu or the keyboard shortcuts. The other two types of breakpoints can be set, but they are set from the Console Pane by using the [Set-PSBreakpoint [m2]](assetId:///88d2d9ad-17dc-44ae-99aa-f841125b9dc8) cmdlet. This section describes how you can perform debugging tasks in [!INCLUDE[ise_2](../Token/ise_2_md.md)] by using the menus where available, and perform a wider range of commands from the Console Pane by using scripting.\n\n### To set a breakpoint\nA breakpoint can be set in a script only after it has been saved. Right\\-click the line where you want to set a line breakpoint, and then click **Toggle Breakpoint**. Or, click the line where you want to set a line breakpoint, and press **F9** or, on the **Debug** menu, click **Toggle Breakpoint**.\n\nThe following script is an example of how you can set a variable breakpoint from the Console Pane by using the [Set-PSBreakpoint](assetId:///6afd5d2c-a285-4796-8607-3cbf49471420) cmdlet.\n\n```\n# This command sets a breakpoint on the Server variable in the Sample.ps1 script.\nset-psbreakpoint -script sample.ps1 -variable Server\n```\n\n### List all breakpoints\nDisplays all breakpoints in the current [!INCLUDE[wps_1](../Token/wps_1_md.md)] session.\n\nOn the **Debug** menu, click **List Breakpoints**. The following script is an example of how you can list all breakpoints from the Console Pane by using the [Get-PSBreakpoint](assetId:///0bf48936-00ab-411c-b5e0-9b10a812a3c6) cmdlet.\n\n```\n# This command lists all breakpoints in the current session. \nget-psbreakpoint\n```\n\n### Remove a breakpoint\nRemoving a breakpoint deletes it.  If you think you might want to use it again later, consider [disabling](#bkmk_disable) it instead.  Right\\-click the line where you want to remove a breakpoint, and then click **Toggle Breakpoint**. Or, click the line where you want to remove a breakpoint, and on the **Debug** menu, click **Toggle Breakpoint**. The following script is an example of how to remove a breakpoint with a specified ID from the Console Pane by using the [Remove-PSBreakpoint](assetId:///4c877a80-0ea0-4790-9281-88c08ef0ddd6) cmdlet.\n\n```\n# This command deletes the breakpoint with breakpoint ID 2.\nremove-psbreakpoint -id 2\n```\n\n### Remove All Breakpoints\nTo remove all breakpoints defined in the current session, on the **Debug** menu, click **Remove All Breakpoints**.\n\nThe following script is an example of how to remove all breakpoints from the Console Pane by using the [Remove-PSBreakpoint](assetId:///4c877a80-0ea0-4790-9281-88c08ef0ddd6) cmdlet.\n\n```\n# This command deletes all of the breakpoints in the current session.\nget-breakpoint | remove-breakpoint\n```\n\n### <a name=\"bkmk_disable\"></a>Disable a Breakpoint\nDisabling a breakpoint does not remove it; it turns it off until it is enabled.  To disable a specific line breakpoint, right\\-click the line where you want to disable a breakpoint, and then click **Disable Breakpoint**. Or, click the line where you want to disable a breakpoint, and press **F9** or, on the **Debug** menu, click **Disable Breakpoint**. The following script is an example of how you can remove a breakpoint with a specified ID from the Console Pane by using the [Disable-PSBreakpoint](assetId:///d4974e9b-0aaa-4e20-b87f-f599a413e4e8) cmdlet.\n\n```\n# This command disables the breakpoint with breakpoint ID 0.\ndisable-psbreakpoint -id 0\n```\n\n### Disable All Breakpoints\nDisabling a breakpoint does not remove it; it turns it off until it is enabled.  To disable all breakpoints in the current session, on the **Debug** menu, click **Disable all Breakpoints**. The following script is an example of how you can disable all breakpoints from the Console Pane by using the [Disable-PSBreakpoint](assetId:///d4974e9b-0aaa-4e20-b87f-f599a413e4e8) cmdlet.\n\n```\n# This command disables all breakpoints in the current session. \n# You can abbreviate this command as: \"gbp | dbp\".\nget-psbreakpoint | disable-psbreakpoint\n```\n\n### Enable a Breakpoint\nTo enable a specific breakpoint, right\\-click the line where you want to enable a breakpoint, and then click **Enable Breakpoint**. Or, click the line where you want to enable a breakpoint, and then press **F9** or, on the **Debug** menu, click **Enable Breakpoint**. The following script is an example of how you can enable specific breakpoints from the Console Pane by using the [Enable-PSBreakpoint](assetId:///739e1091-3b3f-405f-a428-bec7543e5df0) cmdlet.\n\n```\n# This command enables breakpoints with breakpoint IDs 0, 1, and 5.\nenable-psbreakpoint -id 0, 1, 5\n```\n\n### Enable All Breakpoints\nTo enable all breakpoints defined in the current session, on the **Debug** menu, click **Enable all Breakpoints**. The following script is an example of how you can enable all breakpoints from the Console Pane by using the [Enable-PSBreakpoint](assetId:///739e1091-3b3f-405f-a428-bec7543e5df0) cmdlet.\n\n```\n# This command enables all breakpoints in the current session. \n# You can abbreviate the command by using their aliases: \"gbp | ebp\".\nget-psbreakpoint | enable-psbreakpoint\n```\n\n## <a name=\"bkmk_2\"></a>How to manage a debugging session\nBefore you start debugging, you must set one or more breakpoints. You cannot set a breakpoint unless the script that you want to debug is saved. For directions on of how to set a breakpoint, see [How to manage breakpoints](#bkmk_1) or [Set-PSBreakpoint](assetId:///6afd5d2c-a285-4796-8607-3cbf49471420). After you start debugging, you cannot edit a script until you stop debugging. A script that has one or more breakpoints set is automatically saved before it is run.\n\n### To start debugging\nPress **F5** or, on the toolbar, click the **Run Script** icon, or on the **Debug** menu click **Run\\/Continue**. The script runs until it encounters the first breakpoint. It pauses operation there and highlights the line on which it paused.\n\n### To continue debugging\nPress **F5** or, on the toolbar, click the **Run Script** icon, or on the **Debug** menu, click **Run\\/Continue** or, in the Console Pane, type **C** and then press **ENTER**. This causes the script to continue running to the next breakpoint or to the end of the script if no further breakpoints are encountered.\n\n### To view the call stack\nThe call stack displays the current run location in the script. If the script is running in a function that was called by a different function, then that is represented in the display by additional rows in the output. The bottom\\-most row displays the original script and the line in it in which a function was called. The next line up shows that function and the line in it in which another function might have been called.  The top\\-most row shows the current context of the current line on which the breakpoint is set.\n\nWhile paused, to see the current call stack, press **CTRL\\+SHIFT\\+D** or, on the **Debug** menu, click **Display Call Stack** or, in the Console Pane, type **K** and then press **ENTER**.\n\n### To stop debugging\nPress **SHIFT\\-F5** or, on the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugger**, or, in the Console Pane, type **Q** and then press **ENTER**.\n\n## <a name=\"bkmk_3\"></a>How to step over, step into, and step out while debugging\nStepping is the process of running one statement at a time. You can stop on a line of code, and examine the values of variables and the state of the system. The following table describes common debugging tasks such as stepping over, stepping into, and stepping out.\n\n||||\n|-|-|-|\n|**Debugging Task**|**Description**|**How to accomplish it in PowerShell ISE**|\n|**Step Into**|Executes the current statement and then stops at the next statement. If the current statement is a function or script call, then the debugger steps into that function or script, otherwise it stops at the next statement.|Press **F11** or, on the **Debug** menu, click **Step Into**, or in the Console Pane, type **S** and press **ENTER**.|\n|**Step Over**|Executes the current statement and then stops at the next statement. If the current statement is a function or script call then the debugger executes the whole function or script, and it stops at the next statement after the function call.|Press **F10** or, on the **Debug** menu, click **Step Over**, or in the Console Pane, type **V** and press **ENTER**.|\n|**Step Out**|Steps out of the current function and up one level if the function is nested. If in the main body, the script is executed to the end, or to the next breakpoint. The skipped statements are executed, but not stepped through.|Press **SHIFT\\+F11**, or on the **Debug** menu, click **Step Out**, or in the Console Pane, type **O** and press **ENTER**.|\n|**Continue**|Continues execution to the end, or to the next breakpoint. The skipped functions and invocations are executed, but not stepped through.|Press **F5** or, on the **Debug** menu, click **Run\\/Continue**, or in the Console Pane, type **C** and press **ENTER**.|\n\n## <a name=\"bkmk_4\"></a>How to display the values of variables while debugging\nYou can display the current values of variables in the script as you step through the code.\n\n### To display the values of standard variables\nUse one of the following methods:\n\n-   In the Script Pane, hover over the variable to display its value as a tool tip.\n\n-   In the Console Pane, type the variable name and press **ENTER**.\n\nAll panes in ISE are always in the same scope. Therefore, while you are debugging a script, the commands that you type in the Console Pane run in script scope. This allows you to use the Console Pane to find the values of variables and call functions that are defined only in the script.\n\n### To display the values of automatic variables\nYou can use the preceding method to display the value of almost all variables while you are debugging a script. However, these methods do not work for the following automatic variables.\n\n-   $\\_\n\n-   $Input\n\n-   $MyInvocation\n\n-   $PSBoundParameters\n\n-   $Args\n\nIf you try to display the value of any of these variables, you get the value of that variable for in an internal pipeline the debugger uses, not the value of the variable in the script. You can work around this for a few variables ($\\_, $Input, $MyInvocation, $PSBoundParameters, and $Args) by using the following method:\n\n1.  In the script, assign the value of the automatic variable to a new variable.\n\n2.  Display the value of the new variable, either by hovering over the new variable in the Script Pane, or by typing the new variable in the Console Pane.\n\nFor example, to display the value of the $MyInvocation variable, in the script, assign the value to a new variable, such as $scriptname, and then hover over or type the $scriptname variable to display its value.\n\n```\n#In MyScript.ps1\n$scriptname = $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path\n\n#In the Console Pane:\nC:\\ps-test> $scriptname\nC:\\ps-test\\MyScript.ps1\n```\n\n## See Also\n[Using the Windows PowerShell ISE](../Topic/Using-the-Windows-PowerShell-ISE.md)\n\n"
