Windows PowerShell allows you to fill in file names and cmdlet names by pressing the **Tab** key.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Tab expansion is controlled by the internal function TabExpansion. Since this function can be modified or overridden, this discussion is a guide to the behavior of the default Windows PowerShell configuration.\n\nTo fill in a filename or path from the available choices automatically, type part of the name and press the **Tab** key. Windows PowerShell will automatically expand the name to the first match that it finds. Pressing the **Tab** key repeatedly will cycle through all of the available choices.\n\nThe tab expansion of cmdlet names is slightly different. To use tab expansion on a cmdlet name, type the entire first part of the name (the verb) and the hyphen that follows it. You can fill in more of the name for a partial match. For example, if you type **get\\-co** and then press the **Tab** key, Windows PowerShell will automatically expand this to the **Get\\-Command** cmdlet (notice that it also changes the case of letters to their standard form). If you press **Tab** key again, Windows PowerShell replaces this with the only other matching cmdlet name, **Get\\-Content**.\n\nYou can use tab expansion repeatedly on the same line. For example, you can use tab expansion on the name of the **Get\\-Content** cmdlet by entering:\n\n```\nPS> Get-Con<Tab>\n```\n\nWhen you press the **Tab** key, the command expands to:\n\n```\nPS> Get-Content\n```\n\nYou can then partially specify the path to the Active Setup log file and use tab expansion again:\n\n```\nPS> Get-Content c:\\windows\\acts<Tab>\n```\n\nWhen you press the **Tab** key, the command expands to:\n\n```\nPS> Get-Content C:\\windows\\actsetup.log\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> One limitation of the tab expansion process is that tabs are always interpreted as attempts to complete a word. If you copy and paste command examples into a Windows PowerShell console, make sure that the sample does not contain tabs; if it does, the results will be unpredictable and will almost certainly not be what you intended.\n\n"}
