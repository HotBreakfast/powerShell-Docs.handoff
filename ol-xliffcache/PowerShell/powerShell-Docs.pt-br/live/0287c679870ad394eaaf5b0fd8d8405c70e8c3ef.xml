The files collection that is associated with a **PowerShellTab** object is a member of this class. An example is the **$psISE.CurrentPowerShellTab.Files** collection.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Load\\( FilePathName \\)\n  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 3.0 and later, and not present in earlier versions. \n\n Loads a .snippets.ps1xml file that contains user\\-defined snippets. The easiest way to create snippets is to use the New\\-IseSnippet cmdlet, which automatically stores them in your profile folder so that they are loaded every time that you start Windows PowerShell ISE.\n\n **FilePathName** – String\n The path and file name to a .snippets.ps1xml file that contains snippet definitions.\n\n```\n# Loads a custom snippet file into the current PowerShell tab.\n$SnipFile = Join-Path ( Split-Path $profile) “Snippets\\MySnips.snippets.ps1xml” $psISE.CurrentPowerShellTab.Snippets.Add($SnipPath)\n\n```\n\n## See Also\n [The ISESnippetObject](The-ISESnippetObject.md) \n [The Windows PowerShell ISE Scripting Object Model](The-Windows-PowerShell-ISE-Scripting-Object-Model.md) \n [Windows PowerShell ISE Object Model Reference](Windows-PowerShell-ISE-Object-Model-Reference.md) \n [The ISE Object Model Hierarchy](The-ISE-Object-Model-Hierarchy.md)\n\n  \n"}
