The following steps explain how to use the resource in a configuration that sets up the web service.\n\n1. Call the [Install-Module](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn807162.aspx) cmdlet to install the **xPSDesiredStateConfiguration** module. **Note**: **Install-Module** is included in the **PowerShellGet** module, which is included in PowerShell 5.0. You can download the **PowerShellGet** module for PowerShell 3.0 and 4.0 at [PackageManagement PowerShell Modules Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49186). \n1. Get an SSL certificate for the DSC Pull server from a trusted Certificate Authority, either within your orgnaization or a public authority. The certificate recieved from the authority is usually in the PFX format. Install the certificate on the node that will become the DSC Pull server in the default location which should be CERT:\\LocalMachine\\My. Make a note of the certificate thumbprint.\n1. Select a GUID to be used as the Registration Key. To generate one using PowerShell enter the following at the PS prompt and press enter: '``` [guid]::newGuid()```'. This key will be used by client nodes as a shared key to authenticate during registration. For more information see [Registration Key](#RegKey) section below.\n1. In the PowerShell ISE, start (F5) the following configuration script (included in the Example folder of the  **xPSDesiredStateConfiguration** module as Sample_xDscWebService.ps1). This script sets up the pull server.\n  \n```powershell\nconfiguration Sample_xDscWebService \n{ \n    param  \n    ( \n            [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost', \n            \n            [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()] \n            [string] $certificateThumbPrint,\n            \n            [Parameter(Mandatory)]\n            [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n            [string] $RegistrationKey \n     ) \n \n \n     Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xPSDesiredStateConfiguration \n\n     Node $NodeName \n     { \n         WindowsFeature DSCServiceFeature \n         { \n             Ensure = \"Present\" \n             Name   = \"DSC-Service\"             \n         } \n \n \n         xDscWebService PSDSCPullServer \n         { \n             Ensure                  = \"Present\" \n             EndpointName            = \"PSDSCPullServer\" \n             Port                    = 8080 \n             PhysicalPath            = \"$env:SystemDrive\\inetpub\\PSDSCPullServer\" \n             CertificateThumbPrint   = $certificateThumbPrint          \n             ModulePath              = \"$env:PROGRAMFILES\\WindowsPowerShell\\DscService\\Modules\" \n             ConfigurationPath       = \"$env:PROGRAMFILES\\WindowsPowerShell\\DscService\\Configuration\"             \n             State                   = \"Started\" \n             DependsOn               = \"[WindowsFeature]DSCServiceFeature\"                         \n         } \n\n        File RegistrationKeyFile\n        {\n            Ensure          ='Present'\n            Type            = 'File'\n            DestinationPath = \"$env:ProgramFiles\\WindowsPowerShell\\DscService\\RegistrationKeys.txt\"\n            Contents        = $RegistrationKey\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n1. Run the configuration, passing the thumbprint of the SSL certificate as the **certificateThumbPrint** parameter and a GUID registration key as the **RegistrationKey** parameter:\n\n```powershell\n# To find the Thumbprint for an installed SSL certificate for use with the pull server list all certifcates in your local store \n# and then copy the thumbprint for the appropriate certificate by reviewing the certificate subjects\ndir Cert:\\LocalMachine\\my\n\n# Then include this thumbprint when running the configuration\nSample_xDSCService -certificateThumbprint 'A7000024B753FA6FFF88E966FD6E19301FAE9CCC' -RegistrationKey '140a952b-b9d6-406b-b416-e0f759c9c0e4' -OutpuPath c:\\Configs\\PullServer\n```\n\n## Registration Key\nTo allow client nodes to register with the server so that they can use configuration names instead of a configuration ID, a registration key which was created by the above configuration is saved in a file named `RegistrationKeys.txt` in `C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\DscService`. The registration key functions as a shared secret used during the initial registration by the client with the pull server. The client will generate a self-signed certificate which is used to uniquely authenticate to the pull server once registration is successfully completed. The thumbprint of the this certificate is stored locally and associated with the URL of the pull server.\n> **Note**: Registration keys are not supported in PowerShell 4.0. \n\nIn order to configure the a node to authenticate with the pull server the registration key needs to be in the metaconfiguration for any target node that will be registering with this pull server. Note that the **RegistrationKey** in the metaconfiguration below is removed after the target machine has successfully registered, and that the value '140a952b-b9d6-406b-b416-e0f759c9c0e4' must match the value stored in the RegistrationKeys.txt file on the pull server. Always treat the registration key value securely, because knowing it allows any target machine to register with the pull server.\n\n```powershell\n[DSCLocalConfigurationManager()]\nconfiguration PullClientConfigID\n{\n    Node localhost\n    {\n        Settings\n        {\n            RefreshMode = 'Pull'\n            RefreshFrequencyMins = 30 \n            RebootNodeIfNeeded = $true\n        }\n        \n        ConfigurationRepositoryWeb CONTOSO-PullSrv\n        {\n            ServerURL = 'https://CONTOSO-PullSrv:8080/PSDSCPullServer.svc'\n            RegistrationKey = '140a952b-b9d6-406b-b416-e0f759c9c0e4'\n            ConfigurationNames = @('ClientConfig')\n        }   \n        \n        ReportServerWeb CONTOSO-PullSrv\n        {\n            ServerURL         = 'https://CONTOSO-PullSrv:8080/PSDSCPullServer.svc'\n            RegistrationKey   = '140a952b-b9d6-406b-b416-e0f759c9c0e4'\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nPullClientConfigID -OutputPath c:\\Configs\\TargetNodes\n```\n> **Note**: The **ReportServerWeb** section allows reporting data to be sent to the pull server. \n\nThe lack of the **ConfigurationID** property in the metaconfiguration file implicitly means that pull server is supporting the V2 version of the pull server protocol so an initial registration is required. Conversely, the presents of a **ConfigurationID** means that the V1 version of the pull server protocol is used and there is no registration processing.\n\n>**Note**: In a PUSH scenario, a bug exists in the current relase that makes it necessary to define a ConfigurationID property in the metaconfiguration file for nodes that have never registered with a pull server. This will force the V1 Pull Server protocol and avoid registration failure messages.\n\n## Placing configurations and resources\nAfter the pull server setup completes, the folders defined by the **ConfigurationPath** and **ModulePath** properties in the pull server configuration are where you will place modules and configurations that will be available for target nodes to pull. These files need to be in a specific format in order for the pull server to correctly process them. \n\n### DSC resource module package format\nEach resource module needs to be zipped and named according the the following pattern **{Module Name}_{Module Version}.zip**. For example, a module named xWebAdminstration with a module version of 3.1.2.0 would be named 'xWebAdministration_3.2.1.0.zip'. Each version of a module must be contained in a single zip file. Since there is only a single version of a resource in each zip file the module format added in WMF 5.0 with support for multiple module versions in a single directory is not supported. This means that before packaging up DSC resource modules for use with pull server you will need to make a small change to the directory structure. The default format of modules containing DSC resource in WMF 5.0 is '{Module Folder}\\{Module Version}\\DscResources\\{DSC Resource Folder}\\'. Before packaging up for the pull server simply remove the **{Module version}** folder so the path becomes '{Module Folder}\\DscResources\\{DSC Resource Folder}\\'. With this change, zip the folder as described above and place these zip files in the **ModulePath** folder.\n\n### Configuration MOF format \nA configuration MOF file needs to be paired with a checksum file so that an LCM on a target node can validate the configuration. To create a checksum, call the [New-DSCCheckSum](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521622.aspx) cmdlet. The cmdlet takes a **Path** parameter that specifies the folder where the configuration MOF is located. The cmdlet creates a checksum file named `ConfigurationMOFName.mof.checksum`, where `ConfigurationMOFName` is the name of the configuration mof file. If there are more than one configuration MOF files in the specified folder, a checksum is created for each configuration in the folder. Place the MOF files and their associated checksum files in the the **ConfigurationPath** folder.\n\n>**Note**: If you change the configuration MOF file in any way, you must also recreate the checksum file.\n\n## Tooling\nIn order to make setting up, validating and managing the pull server easier, the following tools are included as examples in the latest version of the xPSDesiredStateConfiguration module:\n1. A module that will help with packaging DSC resource modules and configuration files for use on the pull server. [PublishModulesAndMofsToPullServer.psm1](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration/blob/dev/DSCPullServerSetup/PublishModulesAndMofsToPullServer.psm1). Examples below:\n\n```powershell\n    # Example 1 - Package all versions of given modules installed locally and MOF files are in c:\\LocalDepot\n     $moduleList = @(\"xWebAdministration\", \"xPhp\") \n     Publish-DSCModuleAndMof -Source C:\\LocalDepot -ModuleNameList $moduleList \n     \n     # Example 2 - Package modules and mof documents from c:\\LocalDepot\n     Publish-DSCModuleAndMof -Source C:\\LocalDepot -Force\n```\n\n1. A script that validates the Pull Server is configured correctly. [PullServerSetupTests.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration/blob/dev/Examples/PullServerDeploymentVerificationTest/PullServerSetupTests.ps1).\n\n\n## Pull client configuration \nThe following topics describe setting up pull clients in detail:\n\n* [Setting up a DSC pull client using a configuration ID](pullClientConfigID.md)\n* [Setting up a DSC pull client using configuration names](pullClientConfigNames.md)\n* [Partial configurations](partialConfigs.md)\n\n\n## See also\n* [Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration Overview](overview.md)\n* [Enacting configurations](enactingConfigurations.md)\n* [How to retrieve node information from DSC pull server](retrieveNodeInfo.md)\n"
