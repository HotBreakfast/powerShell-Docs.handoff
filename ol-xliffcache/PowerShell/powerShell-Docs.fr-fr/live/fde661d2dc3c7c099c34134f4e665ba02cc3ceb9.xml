The module contains both the schema (the definition of the configurable properties) and the implementation (the code that does the actual work specified by a configuration) for the resource. A DSC resource schema can be defined in a MOF file, and the implementation is performed by a script module. Beginning with the support of PowerShell classes in version 5, the schema and implementation can both be defined in a class.
